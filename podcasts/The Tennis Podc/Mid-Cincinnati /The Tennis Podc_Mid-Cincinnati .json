Before we get underway with this edition of the Tennis Podcast, I'm here to remind you about US Open Fan Week, which begins Tuesday August 22nd and runs to Sunday August 27th. You can get into the grounds at Flushing Meadows free for any of those six days and there'll be some amazing tennis star studded events and activities for all. They also have ticketed feature events during Fan Week that you don't want to miss, including Stars of the Open on Wednesday August 23rd. That's scheduled to feature exhibition matches including defending US Open champion Carlos Alcaraz, Alina Svitolina, Francis Tiafoe, Maria Sacari, Chris Eubanks, Jessica Bergula, Matteo Baratini and for the retro lovers amongst you, John McEnroe. Flavours of the US Open, the US Open's signature culinary event is back on Thursday August 24th and will offer attendees a wide range of food and beverage options coupled with celebrity chefs and top tennis talent on the court. The US Open is one of the world's highest attended annual sporting events, renowned for providing fans with an unparalleled experience, equal parts sport and spectacle. And in 2023, the US Open celebrates 50 years of equal prize money for men and women tennis players. In 1973, the US Open became the first of the four Grand Slam tournaments to offer equal prize money, a pioneering move that shook the sport and began to reshape it towards a more equitable future. Main draw of this year's event takes place August the 28th to September the 10th. To learn more about everything happening at the 2023 US Open, visit usopen.org. Well, that was a tough act to follow, wasn't it? Thank you to Benjamin, who is 11 years old. Benjamin Weinstein and his intro was bought for him by his dad, Ken. They're from Brookline, Massachusetts and regularly listen on their way to playing tennis together. Benjamin watched his first pro tournament in person at Newport for the semis and finals recently. So I can only assume, having watched Adrian Manorino win the title for his first ever tennis watching experience, that his tennis fandom is already on the way. David's here. Hello, David. Hello. Hello. I am actually curious. Are there out there Adrian Manorino fans? I bet my dad's an Adrian Manorino fan. I really want to know. I sort of have a some think of a curiosity to watch him play against really good players and see how bananas he can drive them. But I don't think I've ever come across somebody who would call themselves a fan. You have, David. Not knowing it, but cameraman Matthew is a big Adrian Manorino fan because he likes his flat backhand. He likes his flat backhand. In fact, if that's what gets you going, there's probably no one more exciting for you than Adrian Manorino. There is a bit of the constant lestian about him in terms of just wind up merchant and sort of doing things differently. So maybe I'm talking myself into getting into Adrian Manorino after about 15 years of not being into him. Okay. Well, you enjoy that, David. Thank you once again to Benjamin for that wonderful intro. If you'd like to get yourself an intro to the tennis podcast, get yourself a shout out. Generally become a friend and support us in what we do. Then the link to do that is in our show notes. Matt's here. Hello, Matt. Hello. I've had my my pre-Grand Slam haircut, so I'm ready. Yeah, Matt's already been compared to Carlos Alcaraz today in appearance by David because Alcaraz, one thing that we haven't covered in recent podcasts is Alcaraz's fade, his new haircut, which you hit the nail on the head, David. He really, even minor changes to his hair are completely transformative, aren't they? He looks like a different guy, just having had sort of half an inch taken off. Makes him look younger. And I've recently been discovering what the word fade means in terms of haircuts. I mean, you just seem to have them all up there, Catherine. You know them all off tap. No problem at all. I'm in touch with the youth, David. When you're a YouTuber, you have to keep in touch with the youth lingo is what I find. Yeah, you might be wondering why we haven't done any more YouTubes. It's because I've had my feel of the youth over the last two weeks. More YouTube to come, Fakes, don't worry. Speaking of Alcaraz. Do worry, depending on how you felt about the YouTubes. Sorry, Matt, back to the tennis. Well, it's not really tennis. It was just that I discovered something about Alcaraz. I found something that he's bad at. Pray tell. Which is drawing. Did you see his attempts to draw on the camera the other day? There was this incredible look of concentration on his face and I thought he was going to come up with some kind of masterpiece. And I think he was trying to draw the emoji with the tongue sticking out. And it was just an absolute disaster. Penis and a scribble. It wasn't that bad. I don't even know what that emoji is really that he was trying for. I know which one it is, but I don't know what it's supposed to imply. And he was terrible at it. Yeah. Given the focus and concentration that went into it, I can only assume he's not very good at drawing. And I felt somewhat relieved actually. Zverev posted something on some sort of social media the other day implying that he was better than Alcaraz at golf. It was there on a golf course and the caption was something on the lines of, I found something we can beat him at, guys. And I just thought, well, you're never going to beat him at tennis with a post like that, dude. Talk about living rent free in your head. Enjoy beating him on the golf course, mate. Speaking of Zverev, he is currently on my telly playing Daniel Medvedev, first match of the day in Cincinnati. That one's on the second court on the center court. It is Sloane Stevens and Marketa Von Drosheva. Matt has that on his screen. I'm on serve on my match. Matt, where are you? We are at 5-3 in the first set to Von Drosheva. Which the wind predictor will feel very validated by. Yeah, they had 72% for the Wimbledon champion. She's done well since Wimbledon. Quietly well. Just won a few matches at sort of every event. Is that well? Well, I think she could have just checked out of the tour for a while, quite honestly. It's such a life adjustment. I wasn't expecting her to suddenly win Canada. I've got eye studs. I actually forgot that David's the guy that sees someone win a slam and then predicts them to win the next 12. If she was suddenly winning everything that she was in, we would go, oh yeah, well of course, she's a Wimbledon champion, doesn't she? Makes sense. But it also makes sense that she's just sort of doing some winning and some not winning and just generally Von Drosheva-ing. The only addition, Catherine, that I've made to the agenda after Matt sent it through, and it is comprehensive, we better get on with it, is to say what's happened to Chris Eubanks since Wimbledon? I was just genuinely curious so that I could go and have a look at his results. Obviously, he didn't win the thing, but he was almost in many ways one of the main stories of Wimbledon. He's won three and he's lost four. Is that par? Well, it's not new par, is it? It's better than his old par, which was being on the challenge at all, not even getting to play ATP level matches. Three wins at tour level. It was not that long ago that he would have snapped your hand off for that. But relative to adjusted expectations of him, especially with what part of the season we're in, quick, hard courts, night sessions, the sort of situations that we predicted would suit him down to the ground. No, it's subpar, which is sports worst turn of phrase, isn't it? Because it means the absolute opposite of what it expresses. But anyway, I think you know what I mean. It's disappointing. He's somebody that I was so looking forward to seeing on this swing and seeing coming up against the top guys and maybe not always winning or even winning much, but making things fun and being a disruptor. You know, seeing top players having to face him for the first time and problem solve. And because he's losing, he's not playing that many matches and we're not getting to see an awful lot of that. I mean, look, he's not alone. There have been quite a lot of upsets in Cincinnati this week. It's all shaping up quite jaggedly on the men's side of things. Tiafoe is gone. The 10th seed he's lost to Stan Wawrinka. His summer has been subpar, significantly subpar. Last night, I actually rewatched his episode of Breakpoint because I got a friend staying with me at the moment and she's a big tennis fan, but hasn't had a chance to watch the second half of the series. And I said, I'd quite like to rewatch that episode, get me pumped up for the US Open. I mean, I don't need pumping up for the US Open, but I thought, oh, that'd be fun. And there was a point in the episode where my friend Felicity, she went, he's such a tease Tiafoe, isn't he? And that really sums him up. I feel like he's teased us with what could be and is failing to deliver on it. I don't, and I don't quite know what's going wrong because he really looks like the same guy. He looks like he's doing all the same things and maybe it's a process, not outcome situation, but remembering back to his press conferences at Wimbledon, he's got a really heightened awareness that your moments in tennis don't last long, your peak doesn't necessarily last all that long, your opening. And he feels like he's in his now. And yes, process, not outcome is a thing. And I know you're thinking if Catherine keeps with this process, not outcome thing, this is going to be a boring podcast for the years to come. But, you know, at some point that has to be an outcome, right? You can't just process, process, process, retire. Like, yeah, you should be focusing on the process, but you're doing that in order to get some outcomes. And he would have had such high hopes for this portion of this season, and it could still happen, but it's going to have to happen out of nowhere now with points to defend in New York. I mean, he has said that he is so motivated by big events and slams and, you know, the US Open in particular. Maybe it's just based off that one run at the US Open last year, but I, in my mind, I sort of think of him as a different player in New York and that ability to light up the night session and be swept up by the crowd and the buzz and the atmosphere in New York. I think I'll probably be judging him more after New York. Like, I think it is possible that he could flick a switch and turn it on out of nowhere in New York. And I mean, his losses since Wimbledon, I mean, I know he was very disappointed with his performance at Wimbledon in particular. He was, you know, he thought he sort of disgraced himself on the court that day. You just said at Wimbledon, like you were doing the grounds announcement. That's a new thing to be self-conscious about. Great. Johnny Perkins is in there. You paused for a split second in the sentence. As you were, Matt. Well, it can't be as I was. I will be thinking about that forever now. Anyway, his losses have been Dan Evans, who was inspired that week and went on to win the title. Milos Raonic, who I think he should be beating Milos Raonic, but that was awkward against Raonic. He was pretty inspired playing at home and just serving him off the court. And then last night against Tamwa Wawrinka, he ran into vintage Wawrinka. I mean, it was extraordinary watching that back this morning. I sort of seen a lot of reports that Wawrinka was playing really well. And I was like, you know, part of me was like, yeah, I bet he hit a few great backhands and people were getting overexcited. But actually, I watched it all. And this is Matt saying that. Yeah, I watched it all. And my god, he was brilliant. And like his comments afterwards, he's really pleased with how he's playing now, Tamwa Wawrinka. And he was doing everything well. It was like vintage Wawrinka. It really was great. So I don't know, I think all of the results you can individually sort of explain, but I suppose it's just the sort of cumulatively, you would expect him to maybe have won one of those matches that he's lost. But he's put such emphasis on the US Open. So I'm willing to sort of wait and see and junction by that. Yeah. We could possibly we could there's an argument we could have had another throwback section of this pod like we did a week ago with Sam Wawrinka and Gherman Fies rolling back the years. My brother sent the message that I've been anticipating for some days and weeks now, which is, is it just possible that Gherman Fies could do the impossible at the US Open? And of course, he quoted me, I only need one. I know. And now that I've heard now that I'm hearing, I only need one in my head again. I'm having all sorts of stupid, sentimental, silly, romantic thoughts. I know you're all rolling your eyes at me. I know. But a moment of indulgence, if you please imagine he's already playing way better tennis than we all thought he would ever play again. Am I right? Yeah. No, played playing way more matches than I even thought he'd be able to play. And I mean, one of my favorite words in tennis podcast vernacular is imagine. So I loved hearing that. But yeah, I'd agree. And even a couple of days ago, I think, first of all, when you saw him get through and win that incredible match at the French Open, assumed that was the moment that we would remember him by and then his body failed. And then he comes up a couple of days ago and I saw Tomani Carioll of the Guardian who's in Cincinnati say Monfils is struggling with his knee in the match that he was watching. I think that was the one against Cameron Norrie. And everybody's talking about it on Twitter. I'm not watching the match. I'm just sort of following it on that. And I'm seeing screenshots of Monfils grimacing and wincing. And I'm thinking, oh, God, I just don't want to see that. If he gets beaten by Norrie or whoever it is, okay, just don't do this to him with a knee injury. He wins the match and then he goes and wins the next one. I mean, I can't remember who he beat yesterday, but somebody could. Alex Domenour, who's been in great form. Although we do now know who Gail Monfils is playing. I was really excited about this Gail Monfils run and then I looked at the draw and he's playing Novat Djokovic for the 19th time, having lost all 18. The problem with rolling back the years for Gail Monfils is that he's rolling back to all the years when he was consistently losing to Novak Djokovic. That is an astonishing head-to-head. It's wild. Maybe it shouldn't be because Djokovic is that good, but to think that they've gone through best part of two decades playing one another when Djokovic was really young and Monfils was the senior of the two and to not beat him once is amazing. Yeah, it's a depressing head-to-head because it's just a match that you... it's gas-gay-na-dahl, isn't it? You just cross it off the schedule. I shouldn't say things like this before the event has happened because it could lead to significant egg on face. And I'm sure anyone trying to hype that match will point to the fact that, you know, Monfils, as we've said, he's been doing a lot of winning recently. He's won, I think, five matches against top 30 players in the last few weeks. Really good wins. And Novak Djokovic has played one set since Wimbledon. It might be a good time to try and catch Novak Djokovic, but we know that tennis is match-ups and that one clearly is a bad one for Monfils. Yeah, that one set 6-4 over Alejandro Davidovic for Kina before Davidovic for Kina retired. Do we have any takes on Novak Djokovic and where he's at or is it just impossible on the basis of that one set? I mean, I don't have any takes, so it's fine if you don't either. Bite faces. Okay. Should have checked before answering that question. I just suspect that would be the case. But yeah. Because it like Davidovic for Kina had had such a good week before that and on a surface that there's no reason why he shouldn't be good on it, but I'm not, I think of him as a as ostensibly clay court specialist and but he showed in that run that he can do it. And I just would have loved to have seen a fully fit Davidovic for Kina for the whole match giving it a go against Djokovic and we didn't get to see that and it's just I hope he's not really badly injured. I mean, he pulled up pretty nastily at the time. I will offer you just a crumb of hope for Monfils historically, which is that Tim Henman arrived into his seventh match against Pete Sampras 6-0 down and won the seventh in Cincinnati and there were a few clips of that being shown on social media this week and he also arrived at 8-0 down against Leighton Hewitt and won their ninth match, but that's not 18-0 is it? Yeah, that's a lot of Tim Henman stats. Well, that's what I've got in my head, Catherine. Okay. The 90s. I do remember him finally beating Leighton Hewitt. Um, staying with the men's for a few moments. Another handful of upsets for Yucasper Rude losing to Max Purcell, 6-4 in the third. Andrei Rublev losing out to Emil Ruiz Savori, 7-6 in the third. Holger Runa retired against Mackenzie Macdonald training by a set and a break and Yannick Sinner losing to Dusan Lajevic in two straight sets. Maybe we should take Sinner apart from those handful of upsets. Is this just sort of run of the mill, tours, ups and downs? Or do we have any specific takes on any of these defeats other than there's a huge amount of depth in the game and particularly at tour level versus Grand Slam level these sort of upsets can happen? Yeah, I think, I think that's probably the overall take. I do think the, the sort of chasing pack of players, you know, Rude, Rublev, Ruina, you know, all of those that we've just listed are not as much of a sort of bankers as we've had as sort of chasing pack players in, in the last 10 years. So, you know, they're, they're young, they're still sort of jostling. They've all, they've all shown a really good peak level, but also they've all shown some inconsistency and yeah, I think. Yeah, they're not Thomas Burdick, are they? No, they're not all David Ferrer or Joe Wilford Songa, you know, who were, who were reliably getting to latter stages and losing to the best players. I think, you know, these players are all great, but they're a bit more susceptible to upsets. Even Kane Ishikori. Even Kane Ishikori. You could rely on him to get to a quarterfinal news to Djokovic. Yeah. Yeah. I'm worried about Ruina. He has lost every match he's played since Wimbledon. Two of them win the Hotman Cup and then to, to Giron in Canada and having to retire against McDonald. I think he's doing that thing of, he's done it quite a lot, playing through little niggles and injuries. And I think it was the wrist towards the start of the year. Now I think it's the back. Something's not right there with, with Ruina. And that's, that's quite a concern at the moment, I would say for him. Hmm. Tricky stage of his career where he is probably the first season he started getting appearance fees, for example, the first season where there, you know, there feels a massive cost to not playing. I'm not suggesting that is the decision-making train of thought, but that is a thing that happens to tennis players in their second season after a breakout. The shape of everything changes, sponsored demands, all of your parameters and metrics of success, suddenly you've got stakeholders in you. It's all just different and weird. And I went really big on my Ruina hype. I still think he's got the goods, but this worries me as well. Because his body is so maxed out, isn't it? And that physicality is so much a part of who he is as a tennis player. He cannot afford to be frail because it's not a, it's not a big, bulky, beefy Stan Rorinka like strength. It's a sinewy strength. It's a Djokovic like strength. And I think it needs to be so finely tuned to work. I don't, don't think he can just sort of bruiser his way through niggles. So yeah, agree. Concern for him. Yannick Sinner losing to Dushan Lajevic. Thoughts, feelings, surprise levels. I am, I find it a bit disappointing really, given that he's come in as the champion to, and look, Dushan Lajevic is a good player who has had some good weeks this year, producing some good results. And I, I'm aware that it's very easy to just not factor him into a result. But the guy has just won on the same surface the week before and I think it's a shame when they don't back it up at all. But you look at the results that have come in the last couple of weeks, there's been a lot of that. Dan Evans had that week of his life in Washington and he's lost both of the matches since then. It isn't easy to back these things up. Again, I think it makes me think of Jessica Bagula, who lost her first set the other day and still ends up winning her match because she's just such a pro. I'm not saying that Sinner's not a pro, but I mean it's, some people have just got that ability to reset and go again. And I suppose it points to how bloody hard it is to play back-to-back Masters 1000 events like that. There's not been many that have won them both. I think of Pat Rafter, Rafael Nadal's done it. You know, there's a couple of others, but it's tough. But I still feel like Sinner has, yeah, it makes me question him just a little bit because now he's got to go and back it up at a grand slam. I suppose there's a slight element here that given how kind of weird some of the last few seasons have been because of COVID and this quite gradual arrival of the two-week Masters events. I can't imagine that Sinner will have played that many back-to-back one-week Masters events after each other. Certainly not that many after he's just, I mean, he'd never won one, had he? So he's certainly not had that experience before. And I don't know, it feels like maybe that's part of the reason why we're seeing some of these upsets for these younger players. Maybe they're just not so used to that quick turnaround in these big events as maybe some of the older players who've grown up their whole career doing it, maybe they are more used to it. I don't know, maybe that's a slight factor in why we're seeing some surprises, but there is a really interesting, quite interesting, factor to all this. And that's the number four seed at the US Open. I think everyone would say that Djokovic and Alcares are clearly one and two in men's tennis at the moment. Medvedev at the US Open, given he's won that event, given he's proved himself in slams, given he's a hard-court specialist, he would probably be third. So you want to avoid them as much as you can in the draw. And obviously that fourth seed is what protects you from them until the semi-finals. And at the moment, Holger Runa is in that position, but obviously him going out has left the door open, except Rublev hasn't been able to take advantage, nor is Ruud, nor is Sinner. And actually Stefano Sitsapas is the only guy left who I think can take that number four seeding at the US Open from Runa. I think he needs to get to the semi-finals in Cincinnati this week. So two more wins against either, well, Herkacs and then either Poparin or Roussevoury. So that's not easy. Those are tough matches, but that's quite a lot at stake, I would say, for Sitsapas, given that he's not got a particularly good record at the US Open. You'd have thought, okay, it doesn't impact what his first week's going to look like. He's still got to get through that first week. But if he can be the fourth seed, that would certainly help him if he were to get to the quarterfinals, just avoid Medvedev, Alcares and Djokovic. So yeah, there's been quite a lot at stake there, and most of them haven't been able to take advantage, but let's see whether Sitsapas can. Very good point. Sitsapas beat Ben Shelton last night in two tie breaks, now plays Herkacs. David, you watched that match. There's quite a lot of Ben Shelton negativity around that is completely unwarranted. People saying, oh, you're nowhere near as good as the hype. The hype being the fact that he reached a grand slam quarterfinal out of nowhere. We said at the time, great, great result, but extremely raw game, lots and lots to work on. I see this as a sort of fact-finding year, just figuring out what life on tour looks like for him, trying to enjoy it. I don't know what the future holds, but you're taking Stefanos Sitsapas to tie breaks. Okay, you're not winning them, but it's not all bad. Not at all. I 100% agree. And to me, we were talking about what's par for Christopher Eubanks. I'd say if I'm Ben's dad, Brian, who's now coaching him full-time, I had the pleasure of meeting him at Wimbledon and had a chat with him. I think Ben is doing exactly what you would hope he would be doing. Yes, maybe you want him to win a few more of the matches that he plays. Of course, you want him to win as many as he can, but he looks really good and is developing nicely. He was the man who beat Eubanks actually in Cincinnati and it was close, but he won the match. He took Sitsapas to these tie breaks. He didn't look like winning. He just looked like keeping it really, really close. And all the way through the sets, I kept thinking this is going to be decided by a few points because Shelton's serve is a mule kick of a serve, that left-handed delivery. And he is athletic and he can rally. He's good enough to rally with Sitsapas, but you could just tell Sitsapas knows how to construct and win important points and really just turn it on and tighten it up. And there'd be just those one or two loose shots from Shelton when it really mattered. And that's what decided both of the tie breaks. It wasn't a surprise at all. I don't necessarily expect Shelton to have a great run at the US Open, but I'd be really encouraged for him for future years. Matt, your, your Cotton Eye Joe moment for this week involves a bee or rather a woman impersonating a bee? Yeah. And also Stefanos Sitsapas, which sort of makes sense that in a very weird situation, Stefanos Sitsapas found himself at the centre of it. I actually thought he dealt with it quite well. Didn't he? Yeah. It was sort of the most mature I've ever seen him be. No pun intended. But yeah, if you just, if you just sort of sent me the transcript of the exchange, what's wrong? There's someone behind me imitating a bee and told me to guess the context. I probably would have said, I don't know, primary school. And, and yet it was the sort of main core of a big tennis event. He was very keen that she not be thrown out. He just, he was to the umpire, he was like, I'll manage the situation. Don't worry, I've got this. Unlike the person sitting behind her. Did you notice that? That the guy in the crowd was like pointing at it. It's her, like sort of telling her. I think if I was sat behind, in like, if I was sat where they were sat, like on the front rows, and there was a woman in front of me, giving us all a bad name by doing bee sounds, just as the player was about to serve. Yeah, I'd be calling them out as well. And also very keen to make it clear it's not me. Yeah. I am in full possession of my marbles. Thank you very much. Yeah, I thought, sit to pass navigated that extremely bizarre situation masterfully. I watched Felix Auger Aliasim beat Matteo Berrettini in the opening round, or rather, I dipped in and out of that match. I watched quite a lot of it and I was really impressed with him, particularly because he lost the first set. I thought he just would not have the confidence to come back in that match. And yeah, but Berrettini served, did suddenly drop off a cliff. He was handed a bit of a gift there from Auger Aliasim, but he really stepped up to it and showed a belief in his game, and in his forehand in particular, that I wasn't expecting to see. I thought his confidence would just be completely shot, but he was playing quite front foot tennis. And they both got quite similar game styles, haven't they? Auger Aliasim and Berrettini, the sort of mechanical looking backhand and the big beefy forehand that you can do so much more with, lots of running around your backhand. And I thought that was pretty big for Auger Aliasim. And then he loses to Adrian Manarino. Now, is that a reversion to the recent Auger Aliasim mean, or is that anyone can lose to Adrian Manarino? That's a good question. I feel it could be a bit of both really, because Manarino is the last person you want to play if you're anything short of your most confident and have your conviction about your game. Auger Aliasim, at the end of last year, he'd have beaten Adrian Manarino comfortably when he was winning those Davis Cup ties. It was all secure. He knew where his head was. He knew what he was trying to do. And he had total confidence that when he tried to do it, he would do it. I just don't think that conviction and confidence and security is there at the moment. And is that because of the injuries he's had and that taking his stability away, has that then led on to losses that then get it to his head? I don't know the exact reasons, but he doesn't look convincing to me. And the bit of that match I saw against Berettini, I saw two players who looked just really unsure of themselves. And I didn't watch all of it. So I take your appraisal of it more than my own, Catherine, but I just feel like he's searching still for whatever the mean of his real form is. But he's not been good for months. And I'm sure the injuries played a part in that. Yeah, absolutely. Rinse and repeat on what Matt and I were saying about him last week, I guess. Zarev's just taking the opening set against Medvedev. Alcaraz is the only player that we haven't really discussed. He's about to play Tommy Paul again, which I'm delighted about because their match last week was brilliant. I will happily watch that match again. Thank you very much. And I wonder if Tommy Paul is quite happy to have the chance again to beat Carlos Alcaraz. I don't know, maybe he would have rather played, insert name of a lesser player than Carlos Alcaraz here. He took three sets Alcaraz to beat Jordan Thompson last night. It was the last match of the day. So it was in the middle of the night for us didn't get the chance to watch much. I've watched a few highlights. There are always highlights after a Carlos Alcaraz match and they don't necessarily give you a good impression of what the match was like because it's just a collection of moments of brilliance for Carlos Alcaraz, which are wonderful and electrifying, but don't necessarily define the match. I have seen a lot of footage of him generally looking just like he could not possibly be enjoying life more. Just fantastically relaxed, joining in with Mexican waves during a delay on the court, just soaking up everything and loving it. Just looking completely unaffected by it, or rather affected by it all, but in all the good ways and none of the bad ways. And we always say, we don't know if that will continue. We desperately hope it will continue. Well, so far it's continuing, touch wood. There was a video that the very good social media team in Canada put out last week, which was to get the players singing the national anthem of Canada. All of them were a bit nervous and wary of how they might look in the edit. Then they just cut to Alcaraz and he just belted out of tune, Canada. It was like, yeah, he was just happy to be there and involved in that video. And I was like, yep, okay, those are the Alcaraz vibes. Wouldn't you love to be the sort of person that when asked to sing just out of context on demand, you go, yeah, all right then, and not shrivel up into a ball of self-loathing. Yeah, I can't wait for Alcaraz, Tommy Paul rerun. That's going to be fun. Moving on to the WTA, could we have a score update on Sloane Stephens and Marketa Von Drosheva, please? First set, Von Drosheva, 7-5. Stephens got the break back, but then Von Drosheva broke again and won the set. Really different flavour in the women's side of things where pretty much all of the big names are still in. A few of them have come close to not being in. Elena Rabakina, three sets for her against Elena Ostapenko last night. That's a fun match at the moment, Rabakina and Ostapenko. Ostapenko hates Rabakina. Why? I don't know whether Ostapenko needs a reason to hate someone. But I think it goes back to their match in Rome where there was definitely some tension there. Oh yes, there was. Last night, Rabakina's sister was in the box roaring. Ostapenko was giving death stares to the Rabakina box. There was a cold handshake, no look handshake from Ostapenko at the end. Yeah, I'm quite into those two playing each other. Looking that up afterwards. Yeah, so Rabakina's still standing, Sabalenka's still standing, but she's had to tough it out as well. Jabbur needed to go all the way to 7-6 in the third to beat Angelina Kalinina. She was down and out in that match. She's not a great closer Kalinina and Jabbur had to take advantage of that and really surge in the dying stages. But it was ropey in a lot of places from Jabbur. Tough watch that one. Yeah, it was quite stressful actually because Jabbur was fine. She was a set in the breakup and playing quite well and then suddenly seemed to get quite tight and stressed and then it really ran away from her. I think she was 5-1 down in that third set. It all just sort of fell apart for about 45 minutes and it really looked like she was going to lose as you say. Watching that my mind did go to what we were saying after the Wimbledon final where it feels like she needs to be a bit of an underdog in one of those big grand slam matches to maybe play a bit more loose and a bit more free. In this match it was only when she was suddenly on the brink of defeat and sort of became the underdog in the match where it felt like she was able to free up and start playing her good tennis again. When she was trying to close it out in two sets she just inexplicably it seemed got quite tight. But in the end a good win I suppose. Her first match since Wimbledon she probably needed to somehow try and put Wimbledon behind her and getting wins will presumably help to do that a little bit. But yeah it was quite a stressful watch actually. Not the sort of fun that you usually associate with Ons Jaber and she's now got another tough one against Donna Vechich who's had two two very impressive tight wins and I did notice Vechich on court after the match yesterday knowing that she was going to play Ons Jaber. She said that they practiced together at Wimbledon and Donna said I told my coach that I'm never practicing with her again presumably because of all the slice and the variety and maybe not just a good practice partner not someone who's going to give you a lot of rhythm and a lot of balls. So yeah she said it in a nice sort of jokey way. I don't think there's any beef between them but yeah intrigued to see how that one goes. Yeah big couple of wins for Donna Vechich. Jennifer Brady and a hard fought win over Victoria Azarenka overnight last night. She'll already be pleased with that week Donna Vechich and I'd say she's got a chance against Ons Jaber. She really shows up for that one. Pegula just keeps on showing up and toughing it out. She was in such a tussle against Martina Trevisan and I did it cross my mind you know. Does she really have the motivation in the stomach given she's already had a great hard-court season. She's got what she needs ahead of the US Open. She might already be feeling a bit overcooked and in need of a rest ahead of a Grand Slam which she presumably has significant ambitions of winning. Does she really have the fire in the belly to get into the trenches to win this one? Well she made me look silly for that thought even crossing my mind because I mean she lives in the trenches doesn't she? She loves it there David. Well it crossed my mind too when I saw her lose that first set because you do ask yourself the question is this hitting the wall? Is this last week was as maybe Yannick Sinner found it a lot a great achievement and blummin' hell got to go again from the start at another tournament same level blummin' it. It's a big ask I think and I have such admiration for her. She's growing on me more and more all the time. Just what an admirable character she is and I am starting to enjoy watching her play more and I just somebody who just keeps showing up when they're not necessarily part of the conversation as much as those three particular big names at the top of the sport and then we had the little flirtation of Barbara Krachikova maybe being in that group as well and Pegula yes she's had some disappointments at the Grand Slams and I think there's still a massive question mark there but week in week out she comes and she plays and she produces and I'm here for that. Yeah Carolina Mukova is having a week two tough wins for her Beatriz Haddad-Meyer she looked down and out in that one she lost the opening set she was having treatment I was talking about the curse again on the WhatsApp group decided to switch over to another match because couldn't bear to watch injured Mukova again check the scores she had won and she backed it up with a win over Petra Martic as well now plays Maria Sakary of course it was Sakary that Mukova beat in the opening round of Roland Garros wasn't it to kind of take up her seeding and scheduled path through that draw. Coco Goth beat Maya Sharif 6-2 6-2 now plays Linda Noskova who I think won a check off with Petra Kvitova didn't she that match was happening yesterday was keeping an eye on it. Svijantec is rolling beat Daniel Collins 6-1 6-love didn't understand really why Daniel Collins wasn't able to make that match closer she was awful she played a kind of dumb dumb match it felt like she not gave up she was still sort of physically putting the effort in she wasn't giving up on points but it felt to me like her mind checked out of that and she just thought I've got no chance here I'm just gonna kind of bash the ball around and the scoreline reflected that one in love for Svijantec. Zheng Xiumen next for Svijantec of course we all have made our assessments of Zheng Xiumen well maybe I'm speaking for you and I shouldn't but I feel like I've made my assessment of how good Zheng Xiumen can be on the basis of one set she won against Igor Svijantec at the French Open last year and she hasn't done what I thought she would do since then she's still incredibly young and I believe she has the talent still to to kick on and achieve good things but I'm interested to see her to see where she stacks up against Svijantec 14 months on. Yeah me too it's such a tennis thing how like you know it's very possible that we'd be doing quite a big section on this podcast if yesterday's match against Venus Williams had gone differently you know Venus Williams was was a set and two love up against Zheng Xiumen before you know and really playing well crushing the ball it was it was incredible it was it was backing up a top 20 win that Venus Williams had had over Veronica Kudama-Tovar a couple of days before just just you know great to see and yet from a Zheng Xiumen perspective it was like well you know what's happening here but then she gets through that match wins you know I think 12 of the last 13 games and now I'm really interested to see how she fares against Igor Svijantec again it's just narratives of players can can just change so so quickly in tennis that it's always so difficult to grasp sort of even even what kind of form a player is in because yesterday was such a match of two halves is is the first half Zheng Xiumen going to show up in which case she's not winning many games against Igor Svijantec or is the Zheng Xiumen that we know she can be going to show up in which case I think she can really push Svijantec it's always sort of fascinating to me how how thin the line seems to be between those two but yeah you're right I think it was that match against Svijantec that really brought it to everyone's attention just how good she could be but the signs have been good recently partnered with Winforset won her first title this is an opportunity now to you know to push on again even if she loses I think I think it would be it would be nice to see her perform well and have another big moment feels like she hasn't had that that moment for a year or so yeah it was awesome seeing Venus Williams beat Veronica Kurumitova it was it was absolutely awesome and I told I was expecting that to be just a cool awesome moment in itself I hadn't got my hopes up for her continuing the run and then there she is is setting a break up against Zheng Xiumen and the stats already been produced about it the fact that it had it happened it would have been the first time she's won back-to-back matches in four years and yeah I suddenly was like this is just the absolute coolest thing ever and I should have just settled settled for the moment because as we know it is the hope that kills but Venus is Venus is an absolute queen and I'm assuming she's got a US Open wildcard I saw the men's wildcards have been announced with the women's as well yeah it'd be her great be her 24th US Open Blumenack that's that's bonkers I mean I remember watching live her final against Martina Hingis and waking up in the middle of the night to watch it I think here in the UK it was um but you you were you were one years one year old Matt at the time yes so I was I was quite likely awake in the middle of the night yeah wow it's mad wow would um would anyone care to make predictions at this stage of proceedings and don't just stick with the prediction you made at the beginning of the week for the sake of it I want to genuinely know on the basis of you know having seen four days of this tournament already so far who who you think's winning each title well Katherine you handed me the Cocoa Golf baton from last week and I dutifully picked it up uh for the predictions but I have to be honest a lot of that was points based I there were there are I don't know how many but there were a lot of points on offer for Cocoa Golf I do think she is looking good I am increasingly persuaded by her and the Brad Goldblum involvement and what he did with Andy Roddick's backhand when he first took over him 20 years ago just makes me think of of the effects he can have and and the ways he maybe has helped clear her mind but then I still come back to what you said the other day what happens if and when she faces Igor Sviontek and I believe well she's in the same half of the draw as her and Sviontek is looking really good so I expect her to win I still think when everything happens if and everybody plays their best tennis I expect Sviontek to win so I'd go for her and in the men's even if she plays Rebecca? Yes at the moment I would have concerns over Rebecca just physically uh after last week and I the US Open will be very interesting to me because I think when those two and so when those top three play their best tennis it's very very close I feel before you could you could really choose any of them and and and it might just be on the day in the men's I would probably go for Djokovic just because he he just looks balanced he looks fresh and I don't know I'd still go with him. Matt? Well unlike David I'm doing badly in the prediction so I have to make predictions and I think are going to happen and and I did go with Igor Sviontek so I will I will stick with that kind of for all the reasons David's just said also I think I think a lot of the players that I would expect to push her might be tired or kind of running out of gas a little bit you know we're back in a Sabalenka hasn't been particularly convincing last couple of tournaments Pugula you know she might hit the wall at some point over the next few rounds like it feels like Sviontek probably should win this tournament so I'll go with her men's side I find it so hard just because I've got I've got very little to go on with Djokovic but I mean other than you know 15 years of him winning everything obviously but in in this moment I don't know how he's looking so much I'll I'll go Alcares on on the same basis as last week if Alcares is in a draw yeah I tend to pick him yeah yeah by the way Catherine I'm not impressed with Medvedev from what I've been watching in this match he's a second 2-1 he's what he's what 2-1 up in the second but he's it's been so erastro and it's really not been a good match at all he looks look I know he's not a power player but he looks underpowered to me yeah and when he tries to heave the ball he's missing it was very really seems like he's only got a rally and eventually Medvedev misses look I only picked him because once again I was too slow off the mark and I missed the pick I really wanted who was that I wanted Sabalenka I don't think I think I would pick Svantec now but I guess Sabalenka's got a chance but I watched Medvedev last week and he he wasn't there at all he looked like his heart wasn't I can't quite remember who he lost to but Diminor right yeah he looked I mean he was 5-1 up in the first set tiebreak in that match I think so well maybe even 6-1 actually should have won that first set but when he didn't it looked to me like he didn't have the stomach for that fight and I thought okay yeah he will he will recognize that wasn't good enough and that he'll need to to find something this week in Cincinnati and I know he loves Cincinnati he's got a good record there I just I don't know I was wrong long story short because you're right David he looks I mean he looks away off beating Zverev at the moment let alone beating any top player and winning the title here so yeah weird I really wasn't expecting him to have a dip in form on the US Hardcourt was was not expecting that at all don't quite know what to read into it I suspect I mean his pre-tournament press conferences are always a joy aren't they but I suspect his I mean look he's still in this tournament but I suspect his pre-US open press conference might be fascinating because he's honest isn't he he'll tell us how he's feeling and and what's going on in his head so that is it I think for your well not for Cincinnati there's still three and a half more days of that and we'll be back to wrap it up on Monday a pod that all being well will be recorded or at least two-thirds recorded from Heathrow Airport again what could go wrong one-third recorded in Solly Hole I expect to be very excited and pumped I am I mean I'm I'm always pumped for for Grand Slam trips they are it I mean it's just an absolute treat and a privilege that we get to go to the four Grand Slams for the pod but going to New York for the US Open is maybe it's because I did it as a kid with my dad a couple of times going going specifically to New York as a fan for the US Open that it sort of triggers those memories for me but I am excited so expect those vibes on Monday's podcast if you can't wait till then for your next podcast and you're a friend of the tennis podcast then you're in luck if you're not a friend of the tennis podcast then you know how to sort that out because yesterday we recorded the Kim Kleister's story it's up and it's available for friends our latest edition of Tennis Relived the US Open edition for this year it includes her finally winning a Grand Slam final at the fifth attempt at Flushing Meadows in 2005 something of course that we ended up serendipitously talking a lot about in the last stages of Wimbledon this year pertaining to Te'wan's Jabir of course but we also talk about her incredible comeback after retirement and giving birth to her daughter Jada to win the US Open in 2009 as a wild card it's a moment that will make you smile to relive the scenes of Kim and her daughter celebrating on the court scenes that I think live long in the memory of so many tennis fans and a victory that was a mix of emotions for Kim herself. Pretty soon after I think when I went to the hotel I kind of had a really bad kind of breakdown moment where I guess the reality of it all sinks in because after my dad had passed away I got invited to play at Wimbledon for the opening of the the roof on Centre Court and kind of started training and I guess looking back on it maybe didn't properly take the time to grieve the loss of my father because it was a very intense year and then because I remember there were moments where you know my dad when he wasn't traveling with me I would kind of always give him a call really quickly before a match if I was a little bit nervous or something and and I'd caught myself walking into the locker room and I think it was before the match against Venus and started dialing his number real quick and I was like oh my god what am I doing like he's not around anymore like what but it was such a habit for me to speak to him even when it was like nighttime in Belgium and so yeah I had that moment which I felt like okay it's the realization of certain losses and they kick in and right up it was great and exciting but then after a while I kind of the you you you think and you have this moment and you relive your the past months years that you've gone through and and I think the reality of it sinks in and and and the disbelief the yeah like what just happened like how is this possible Yeah that just a snippet of the incredible contribution that Kim Kleister herself made to this podcast she was so generous with her time she told stories and gave perspectives that I've never heard before despite Kleister's 2009 US Open win being right in the speed spot of my tennis fandom I followed that run so closely and I remember those scenes of her and Jade are on the court celebrating afterwards so vividly I still learned so much about Kim and and her story over the course of that episode so that is up and available for friends if you'd like to become a friend the link to do that is in our show notes already a friend is Katie Sullivan because she has brought today's episode mascot Usher into our lives Usher is a 12 year old labradoodle from British Columbia Kate and her husband got

Before we get underway with this edition of the Tennis Podcast, I'm here to remind you about US Open Fan Week, which begins Tuesday August 22nd and runs to Sunday August 27th. You can get into the grounds at Flushing Meadows free for any of those six days and there'll be some amazing tennis star studded events and activities for all. They also have ticketed feature events during Fan Week that you don't want to miss, including Stars of the Open on Wednesday August 23rd. That's scheduled to feature exhibition matches including defending US Open champion Carlos Alcaraz, Alina Svitolina, Francis Tiafoe, Maria Sacari, Chris Eubanks, Jessica Bergula, Matteo Baratini and for the retro lovers amongst you, John McEnroe. Flavours of the US Open, the US Open's signature culinary event is back on Thursday August 24th and will offer attendees a wide range of food and beverage options coupled with celebrity chefs and top tennis talent on the court. The US Open is one of the world's highest attended annual sporting events, renowned for providing fans with an unparalleled experience, equal parts sport and spectacle. And in 2023, the US Open celebrates 50 years of equal prize money for men and women tennis players. In 1973, the US Open became the first of the four Grand Slam tournaments to offer equal prize money, a pioneering move that shook the sport and began to reshape it towards a more equitable future. Main draw of this year's event takes place August the 28th to September the 10th. To learn more about everything happening at the 2023 US Open, visit usopen.org. Well, that was a tough act to follow, wasn't it? Thank you to Benjamin, who is 11 years old. Benjamin Weinstein and his intro was bought for him by his dad, Ken. They're from Brookline, Massachusetts and regularly listen on their way to playing tennis together. Benjamin watched his first pro tournament in person at Newport for the semis and finals recently. So I can only assume, having watched Adrian Manorino win the title for his first ever tennis watching experience, that his tennis fandom is already on the way. David's here. Hello, David. Hello. Hello. I am actually curious. Are there out there Adrian Manorino fans? I bet my dad's an Adrian Manorino fan. I really want to know. I sort of have a some think of a curiosity to watch him play against really good players and see how bananas he can drive them. But I don't think I've ever come across somebody who would call themselves a fan. You have, David. Not knowing it, but cameraman Matthew is a big Adrian Manorino fan because he likes his flat backhand. He likes his flat backhand. In fact, if that's what gets you going, there's probably no one more exciting for you than Adrian Manorino. There is a bit of the constant lestian about him in terms of just wind up merchant and sort of doing things differently. So maybe I'm talking myself into getting into Adrian Manorino after about 15 years of not being into him. Okay. Well, you enjoy that, David. Thank you once again to Benjamin for that wonderful intro. If you'd like to get yourself an intro to the tennis podcast, get yourself a shout out. Generally become a friend and support us in what we do. Then the link to do that is in our show notes. Matt's here. Hello, Matt. Hello. I've had my my pre-Grand Slam haircut, so I'm ready. Yeah, Matt's already been compared to Carlos Alcaraz today in appearance by David because Alcaraz, one thing that we haven't covered in recent podcasts is Alcaraz's fade, his new haircut, which you hit the nail on the head, David. He really, even minor changes to his hair are completely transformative, aren't they? He looks like a different guy, just having had sort of half an inch taken off. Makes him look younger. And I've recently been discovering what the word fade means in terms of haircuts. I mean, you just seem to have them all up there, Catherine. You know them all off tap. No problem at all. I'm in touch with the youth, David. When you're a YouTuber, you have to keep in touch with the youth lingo is what I find. Yeah, you might be wondering why we haven't done any more YouTubes. It's because I've had my feel of the youth over the last two weeks. More YouTube to come, Fakes, don't worry. Speaking of Alcaraz. Do worry, depending on how you felt about the YouTubes. Sorry, Matt, back to the tennis. Well, it's not really tennis. It was just that I discovered something about Alcaraz. I found something that he's bad at. Pray tell. Which is drawing. Did you see his attempts to draw on the camera the other day? There was this incredible look of concentration on his face and I thought he was going to come up with some kind of masterpiece. And I think he was trying to draw the emoji with the tongue sticking out. And it was just an absolute disaster. Penis and a scribble. It wasn't that bad. I don't even know what that emoji is really that he was trying for. I know which one it is, but I don't know what it's supposed to imply. And he was terrible at it. Yeah. Given the focus and concentration that went into it, I can only assume he's not very good at drawing. And I felt somewhat relieved actually. Zverev posted something on some sort of social media the other day implying that he was better than Alcaraz at golf. It was there on a golf course and the caption was something on the lines of, I found something we can beat him at, guys. And I just thought, well, you're never going to beat him at tennis with a post like that, dude. Talk about living rent free in your head. Enjoy beating him on the golf course, mate. Speaking of Zverev, he is currently on my telly playing Daniel Medvedev, first match of the day in Cincinnati. That one's on the second court on the center court. It is Sloane Stevens and Marketa Von Drosheva. Matt has that on his screen. I'm on serve on my match. Matt, where are you? We are at 5-3 in the first set to Von Drosheva. Which the wind predictor will feel very validated by. Yeah, they had 72% for the Wimbledon champion. She's done well since Wimbledon. Quietly well. Just won a few matches at sort of every event. Is that well? Well, I think she could have just checked out of the tour for a while, quite honestly. It's such a life adjustment. I wasn't expecting her to suddenly win Canada. I've got eye studs. I actually forgot that David's the guy that sees someone win a slam and then predicts them to win the next 12. If she was suddenly winning everything that she was in, we would go, oh yeah, well of course, she's a Wimbledon champion, doesn't she? Makes sense. But it also makes sense that she's just sort of doing some winning and some not winning and just generally Von Drosheva-ing. The only addition, Catherine, that I've made to the agenda after Matt sent it through, and it is comprehensive, we better get on with it, is to say what's happened to Chris Eubanks since Wimbledon? I was just genuinely curious so that I could go and have a look at his results. Obviously, he didn't win the thing, but he was almost in many ways one of the main stories of Wimbledon. He's won three and he's lost four. Is that par? Well, it's not new par, is it? It's better than his old par, which was being on the challenge at all, not even getting to play ATP level matches. Three wins at tour level. It was not that long ago that he would have snapped your hand off for that. But relative to adjusted expectations of him, especially with what part of the season we're in, quick, hard courts, night sessions, the sort of situations that we predicted would suit him down to the ground. No, it's subpar, which is sports worst turn of phrase, isn't it? Because it means the absolute opposite of what it expresses. But anyway, I think you know what I mean. It's disappointing. He's somebody that I was so looking forward to seeing on this swing and seeing coming up against the top guys and maybe not always winning or even winning much, but making things fun and being a disruptor. You know, seeing top players having to face him for the first time and problem solve. And because he's losing, he's not playing that many matches and we're not getting to see an awful lot of that. I mean, look, he's not alone. There have been quite a lot of upsets in Cincinnati this week. It's all shaping up quite jaggedly on the men's side of things. Tiafoe is gone. The 10th seed he's lost to Stan Wawrinka. His summer has been subpar, significantly subpar. Last night, I actually rewatched his episode of Breakpoint because I got a friend staying with me at the moment and she's a big tennis fan, but hasn't had a chance to watch the second half of the series. And I said, I'd quite like to rewatch that episode, get me pumped up for the US Open. I mean, I don't need pumping up for the US Open, but I thought, oh, that'd be fun. And there was a point in the episode where my friend Felicity, she went, he's such a tease Tiafoe, isn't he? And that really sums him up. I feel like he's teased us with what could be and is failing to deliver on it. I don't, and I don't quite know what's going wrong because he really looks like the same guy. He looks like he's doing all the same things and maybe it's a process, not outcome situation, but remembering back to his press conferences at Wimbledon, he's got a really heightened awareness that your moments in tennis don't last long, your peak doesn't necessarily last all that long, your opening. And he feels like he's in his now. And yes, process, not outcome is a thing. And I know you're thinking if Catherine keeps with this process, not outcome thing, this is going to be a boring podcast for the years to come. But, you know, at some point that has to be an outcome, right? You can't just process, process, process, retire. Like, yeah, you should be focusing on the process, but you're doing that in order to get some outcomes. And he would have had such high hopes for this portion of this season, and it could still happen, but it's going to have to happen out of nowhere now with points to defend in New York. I mean, he has said that he is so motivated by big events and slams and, you know, the US Open in particular. Maybe it's just based off that one run at the US Open last year, but I, in my mind, I sort of think of him as a different player in New York and that ability to light up the night session and be swept up by the crowd and the buzz and the atmosphere in New York. I think I'll probably be judging him more after New York. Like, I think it is possible that he could flick a switch and turn it on out of nowhere in New York. And I mean, his losses since Wimbledon, I mean, I know he was very disappointed with his performance at Wimbledon in particular. He was, you know, he thought he sort of disgraced himself on the court that day. You just said at Wimbledon, like you were doing the grounds announcement. That's a new thing to be self-conscious about. Great. Johnny Perkins is in there. You paused for a split second in the sentence. As you were, Matt. Well, it can't be as I was. I will be thinking about that forever now. Anyway, his losses have been Dan Evans, who was inspired that week and went on to win the title. Milos Raonic, who I think he should be beating Milos Raonic, but that was awkward against Raonic. He was pretty inspired playing at home and just serving him off the court. And then last night against Tamwa Wawrinka, he ran into vintage Wawrinka. I mean, it was extraordinary watching that back this morning. I sort of seen a lot of reports that Wawrinka was playing really well. And I was like, you know, part of me was like, yeah, I bet he hit a few great backhands and people were getting overexcited. But actually, I watched it all. And this is Matt saying that. Yeah, I watched it all. And my god, he was brilliant. And like his comments afterwards, he's really pleased with how he's playing now, Tamwa Wawrinka. And he was doing everything well. It was like vintage Wawrinka. It really was great. So I don't know, I think all of the results you can individually sort of explain, but I suppose it's just the sort of cumulatively, you would expect him to maybe have won one of those matches that he's lost. But he's put such emphasis on the US Open. So I'm willing to sort of wait and see and junction by that. Yeah. We could possibly we could there's an argument we could have had another throwback section of this pod like we did a week ago with Sam Wawrinka and Gherman Fies rolling back the years. My brother sent the message that I've been anticipating for some days and weeks now, which is, is it just possible that Gherman Fies could do the impossible at the US Open? And of course, he quoted me, I only need one. I know. And now that I've heard now that I'm hearing, I only need one in my head again. I'm having all sorts of stupid, sentimental, silly, romantic thoughts. I know you're all rolling your eyes at me. I know. But a moment of indulgence, if you please imagine he's already playing way better tennis than we all thought he would ever play again. Am I right? Yeah. No, played playing way more matches than I even thought he'd be able to play. And I mean, one of my favorite words in tennis podcast vernacular is imagine. So I loved hearing that. But yeah, I'd agree. And even a couple of days ago, I think, first of all, when you saw him get through and win that incredible match at the French Open, assumed that was the moment that we would remember him by and then his body failed. And then he comes up a couple of days ago and I saw Tomani Carioll of the Guardian who's in Cincinnati say Monfils is struggling with his knee in the match that he was watching. I think that was the one against Cameron Norrie. And everybody's talking about it on Twitter. I'm not watching the match. I'm just sort of following it on that. And I'm seeing screenshots of Monfils grimacing and wincing. And I'm thinking, oh, God, I just don't want to see that. If he gets beaten by Norrie or whoever it is, okay, just don't do this to him with a knee injury. He wins the match and then he goes and wins the next one. I mean, I can't remember who he beat yesterday, but somebody could. Alex Domenour, who's been in great form. Although we do now know who Gail Monfils is playing. I was really excited about this Gail Monfils run and then I looked at the draw and he's playing Novat Djokovic for the 19th time, having lost all 18. The problem with rolling back the years for Gail Monfils is that he's rolling back to all the years when he was consistently losing to Novak Djokovic. That is an astonishing head-to-head. It's wild. Maybe it shouldn't be because Djokovic is that good, but to think that they've gone through best part of two decades playing one another when Djokovic was really young and Monfils was the senior of the two and to not beat him once is amazing. Yeah, it's a depressing head-to-head because it's just a match that you... it's gas-gay-na-dahl, isn't it? You just cross it off the schedule. I shouldn't say things like this before the event has happened because it could lead to significant egg on face. And I'm sure anyone trying to hype that match will point to the fact that, you know, Monfils, as we've said, he's been doing a lot of winning recently. He's won, I think, five matches against top 30 players in the last few weeks. Really good wins. And Novak Djokovic has played one set since Wimbledon. It might be a good time to try and catch Novak Djokovic, but we know that tennis is match-ups and that one clearly is a bad one for Monfils. Yeah, that one set 6-4 over Alejandro Davidovic for Kina before Davidovic for Kina retired. Do we have any takes on Novak Djokovic and where he's at or is it just impossible on the basis of that one set? I mean, I don't have any takes, so it's fine if you don't either. Bite faces. Okay. Should have checked before answering that question. I just suspect that would be the case. But yeah. Because it like Davidovic for Kina had had such a good week before that and on a surface that there's no reason why he shouldn't be good on it, but I'm not, I think of him as a as ostensibly clay court specialist and but he showed in that run that he can do it. And I just would have loved to have seen a fully fit Davidovic for Kina for the whole match giving it a go against Djokovic and we didn't get to see that and it's just I hope he's not really badly injured. I mean, he pulled up pretty nastily at the time. I will offer you just a crumb of hope for Monfils historically, which is that Tim Henman arrived into his seventh match against Pete Sampras 6-0 down and won the seventh in Cincinnati and there were a few clips of that being shown on social media this week and he also arrived at 8-0 down against Leighton Hewitt and won their ninth match, but that's not 18-0 is it? Yeah, that's a lot of Tim Henman stats. Well, that's what I've got in my head, Catherine. Okay. The 90s. I do remember him finally beating Leighton Hewitt. Um, staying with the men's for a few moments. Another handful of upsets for Yucasper Rude losing to Max Purcell, 6-4 in the third. Andrei Rublev losing out to Emil Ruiz Savori, 7-6 in the third. Holger Runa retired against Mackenzie Macdonald training by a set and a break and Yannick Sinner losing to Dusan Lajevic in two straight sets. Maybe we should take Sinner apart from those handful of upsets. Is this just sort of run of the mill, tours, ups and downs? Or do we have any specific takes on any of these defeats other than there's a huge amount of depth in the game and particularly at tour level versus Grand Slam level these sort of upsets can happen? Yeah, I think, I think that's probably the overall take. I do think the, the sort of chasing pack of players, you know, Rude, Rublev, Ruina, you know, all of those that we've just listed are not as much of a sort of bankers as we've had as sort of chasing pack players in, in the last 10 years. So, you know, they're, they're young, they're still sort of jostling. They've all, they've all shown a really good peak level, but also they've all shown some inconsistency and yeah, I think. Yeah, they're not Thomas Burdick, are they? No, they're not all David Ferrer or Joe Wilford Songa, you know, who were, who were reliably getting to latter stages and losing to the best players. I think, you know, these players are all great, but they're a bit more susceptible to upsets. Even Kane Ishikori. Even Kane Ishikori. You could rely on him to get to a quarterfinal news to Djokovic. Yeah. Yeah. I'm worried about Ruina. He has lost every match he's played since Wimbledon. Two of them win the Hotman Cup and then to, to Giron in Canada and having to retire against McDonald. I think he's doing that thing of, he's done it quite a lot, playing through little niggles and injuries. And I think it was the wrist towards the start of the year. Now I think it's the back. Something's not right there with, with Ruina. And that's, that's quite a concern at the moment, I would say for him. Hmm. Tricky stage of his career where he is probably the first season he started getting appearance fees, for example, the first season where there, you know, there feels a massive cost to not playing. I'm not suggesting that is the decision-making train of thought, but that is a thing that happens to tennis players in their second season after a breakout. The shape of everything changes, sponsored demands, all of your parameters and metrics of success, suddenly you've got stakeholders in you. It's all just different and weird. And I went really big on my Ruina hype. I still think he's got the goods, but this worries me as well. Because his body is so maxed out, isn't it? And that physicality is so much a part of who he is as a tennis player. He cannot afford to be frail because it's not a, it's not a big, bulky, beefy Stan Rorinka like strength. It's a sinewy strength. It's a Djokovic like strength. And I think it needs to be so finely tuned to work. I don't, don't think he can just sort of bruiser his way through niggles. So yeah, agree. Concern for him. Yannick Sinner losing to Dushan Lajevic. Thoughts, feelings, surprise levels. I am, I find it a bit disappointing really, given that he's come in as the champion to, and look, Dushan Lajevic is a good player who has had some good weeks this year, producing some good results. And I, I'm aware that it's very easy to just not factor him into a result. But the guy has just won on the same surface the week before and I think it's a shame when they don't back it up at all. But you look at the results that have come in the last couple of weeks, there's been a lot of that. Dan Evans had that week of his life in Washington and he's lost both of the matches since then. It isn't easy to back these things up. Again, I think it makes me think of Jessica Bagula, who lost her first set the other day and still ends up winning her match because she's just such a pro. I'm not saying that Sinner's not a pro, but I mean it's, some people have just got that ability to reset and go again. And I suppose it points to how bloody hard it is to play back-to-back Masters 1000 events like that. There's not been many that have won them both. I think of Pat Rafter, Rafael Nadal's done it. You know, there's a couple of others, but it's tough. But I still feel like Sinner has, yeah, it makes me question him just a little bit because now he's got to go and back it up at a grand slam. I suppose there's a slight element here that given how kind of weird some of the last few seasons have been because of COVID and this quite gradual arrival of the two-week Masters events. I can't imagine that Sinner will have played that many back-to-back one-week Masters events after each other. Certainly not that many after he's just, I mean, he'd never won one, had he? So he's certainly not had that experience before. And I don't know, it feels like maybe that's part of the reason why we're seeing some of these upsets for these younger players. Maybe they're just not so used to that quick turnaround in these big events as maybe some of the older players who've grown up their whole career doing it, maybe they are more used to it. I don't know, maybe that's a slight factor in why we're seeing some surprises, but there is a really interesting, quite interesting, factor to all this. And that's the number four seed at the US Open. I think everyone would say that Djokovic and Alcares are clearly one and two in men's tennis at the moment. Medvedev at the US Open, given he's won that event, given he's proved himself in slams, given he's a hard-court specialist, he would probably be third. So you want to avoid them as much as you can in the draw. And obviously that fourth seed is what protects you from them until the semi-finals. And at the moment, Holger Runa is in that position, but obviously him going out has left the door open, except Rublev hasn't been able to take advantage, nor is Ruud, nor is Sinner. And actually Stefano Sitsapas is the only guy left who I think can take that number four seeding at the US Open from Runa. I think he needs to get to the semi-finals in Cincinnati this week. So two more wins against either, well, Herkacs and then either Poparin or Roussevoury. So that's not easy. Those are tough matches, but that's quite a lot at stake, I would say, for Sitsapas, given that he's not got a particularly good record at the US Open. You'd have thought, okay, it doesn't impact what his first week's going to look like. He's still got to get through that first week. But if he can be the fourth seed, that would certainly help him if he were to get to the quarterfinals, just avoid Medvedev, Alcares and Djokovic. So yeah, there's been quite a lot at stake there, and most of them haven't been able to take advantage, but let's see whether Sitsapas can. Very good point. Sitsapas beat Ben Shelton last night in two tie breaks, now plays Herkacs. David, you watched that match. There's quite a lot of Ben Shelton negativity around that is completely unwarranted. People saying, oh, you're nowhere near as good as the hype. The hype being the fact that he reached a grand slam quarterfinal out of nowhere. We said at the time, great, great result, but extremely raw game, lots and lots to work on. I see this as a sort of fact-finding year, just figuring out what life on tour looks like for him, trying to enjoy it. I don't know what the future holds, but you're taking Stefanos Sitsapas to tie breaks. Okay, you're not winning them, but it's not all bad. Not at all. I 100% agree. And to me, we were talking about what's par for Christopher Eubanks. I'd say if I'm Ben's dad, Brian, who's now coaching him full-time, I had the pleasure of meeting him at Wimbledon and had a chat with him. I think Ben is doing exactly what you would hope he would be doing. Yes, maybe you want him to win a few more of the matches that he plays. Of course, you want him to win as many as he can, but he looks really good and is developing nicely. He was the man who beat Eubanks actually in Cincinnati and it was close, but he won the match. He took Sitsapas to these tie breaks. He didn't look like winning. He just looked like keeping it really, really close. And all the way through the sets, I kept thinking this is going to be decided by a few points because Shelton's serve is a mule kick of a serve, that left-handed delivery. And he is athletic and he can rally. He's good enough to rally with Sitsapas, but you could just tell Sitsapas knows how to construct and win important points and really just turn it on and tighten it up. And there'd be just those one or two loose shots from Shelton when it really mattered. And that's what decided both of the tie breaks. It wasn't a surprise at all. I don't necessarily expect Shelton to have a great run at the US Open, but I'd be really encouraged for him for future years. Matt, your, your Cotton Eye Joe moment for this week involves a bee or rather a woman impersonating a bee? Yeah. And also Stefanos Sitsapas, which sort of makes sense that in a very weird situation, Stefanos Sitsapas found himself at the centre of it. I actually thought he dealt with it quite well. Didn't he? Yeah. It was sort of the most mature I've ever seen him be. No pun intended. But yeah, if you just, if you just sort of sent me the transcript of the exchange, what's wrong? There's someone behind me imitating a bee and told me to guess the context. I probably would have said, I don't know, primary school. And, and yet it was the sort of main core of a big tennis event. He was very keen that she not be thrown out. He just, he was to the umpire, he was like, I'll manage the situation. Don't worry, I've got this. Unlike the person sitting behind her. Did you notice that? That the guy in the crowd was like pointing at it. It's her, like sort of telling her. I think if I was sat behind, in like, if I was sat where they were sat, like on the front rows, and there was a woman in front of me, giving us all a bad name by doing bee sounds, just as the player was about to serve. Yeah, I'd be calling them out as well. And also very keen to make it clear it's not me. Yeah. I am in full possession of my marbles. Thank you very much. Yeah, I thought, sit to pass navigated that extremely bizarre situation masterfully. I watched Felix Auger Aliasim beat Matteo Berrettini in the opening round, or rather, I dipped in and out of that match. I watched quite a lot of it and I was really impressed with him, particularly because he lost the first set. I thought he just would not have the confidence to come back in that match. And yeah, but Berrettini served, did suddenly drop off a cliff. He was handed a bit of a gift there from Auger Aliasim, but he really stepped up to it and showed a belief in his game, and in his forehand in particular, that I wasn't expecting to see. I thought his confidence would just be completely shot, but he was playing quite front foot tennis. And they both got quite similar game styles, haven't they? Auger Aliasim and Berrettini, the sort of mechanical looking backhand and the big beefy forehand that you can do so much more with, lots of running around your backhand. And I thought that was pretty big for Auger Aliasim. And then he loses to Adrian Manarino. Now, is that a reversion to the recent Auger Aliasim mean, or is that anyone can lose to Adrian Manarino? That's a good question. I feel it could be a bit of both really, because Manarino is the last person you want to play if you're anything short of your most confident and have your conviction about your game. Auger Aliasim, at the end of last year, he'd have beaten Adrian Manarino comfortably when he was winning those Davis Cup ties. It was all secure. He knew where his head was. He knew what he was trying to do. And he had total confidence that when he tried to do it, he would do it. I just don't think that conviction and confidence and security is there at the moment. And is that because of the injuries he's had and that taking his stability away, has that then led on to losses that then get it to his head? I don't know the exact reasons, but he doesn't look convincing to me. And the bit of that match I saw against Berettini, I saw two players who looked just really unsure of themselves. And I didn't watch all of it. So I take your appraisal of it more than my own, Catherine, but I just feel like he's searching still for whatever the mean of his real form is. But he's not been good for months. And I'm sure the injuries played a part in that. Yeah, absolutely. Rinse and repeat on what Matt and I were saying about him last week, I guess. Zarev's just taking the opening set against Medvedev. Alcaraz is the only player that we haven't really discussed. He's about to play Tommy Paul again, which I'm delighted about because their match last week was brilliant. I will happily watch that match again. Thank you very much. And I wonder if Tommy Paul is quite happy to have the chance again to beat Carlos Alcaraz. I don't know, maybe he would have rather played, insert name of a lesser player than Carlos Alcaraz here. He took three sets Alcaraz to beat Jordan Thompson last night. It was the last match of the day. So it was in the middle of the night for us didn't get the chance to watch much. I've watched a few highlights. There are always highlights after a Carlos Alcaraz match and they don't necessarily give you a good impression of what the match was like because it's just a collection of moments of brilliance for Carlos Alcaraz, which are wonderful and electrifying, but don't necessarily define the match. I have seen a lot of footage of him generally looking just like he could not possibly be enjoying life more. Just fantastically relaxed, joining in with Mexican waves during a delay on the court, just soaking up everything and loving it. Just looking completely unaffected by it, or rather affected by it all, but in all the good ways and none of the bad ways. And we always say, we don't know if that will continue. We desperately hope it will continue. Well, so far it's continuing, touch wood. There was a video that the very good social media team in Canada put out last week, which was to get the players singing the national anthem of Canada. All of them were a bit nervous and wary of how they might look in the edit. Then they just cut to Alcaraz and he just belted out of tune, Canada. It was like, yeah, he was just happy to be there and involved in that video. And I was like, yep, okay, those are the Alcaraz vibes. Wouldn't you love to be the sort of person that when asked to sing just out of context on demand, you go, yeah, all right then, and not shrivel up into a ball of self-loathing. Yeah, I can't wait for Alcaraz, Tommy Paul rerun. That's going to be fun. Moving on to the WTA, could we have a score update on Sloane Stephens and Marketa Von Drosheva, please? First set, Von Drosheva, 7-5. Stephens got the break back, but then Von Drosheva broke again and won the set. Really different flavour in the women's side of things where pretty much all of the big names are still in. A few of them have come close to not being in. Elena Rabakina, three sets for her against Elena Ostapenko last night. That's a fun match at the moment, Rabakina and Ostapenko. Ostapenko hates Rabakina. Why? I don't know whether Ostapenko needs a reason to hate someone. But I think it goes back to their match in Rome where there was definitely some tension there. Oh yes, there was. Last night, Rabakina's sister was in the box roaring. Ostapenko was giving death stares to the Rabakina box. There was a cold handshake, no look handshake from Ostapenko at the end. Yeah, I'm quite into those two playing each other. Looking that up afterwards. Yeah, so Rabakina's still standing, Sabalenka's still standing, but she's had to tough it out as well. Jabbur needed to go all the way to 7-6 in the third to beat Angelina Kalinina. She was down and out in that match. She's not a great closer Kalinina and Jabbur had to take advantage of that and really surge in the dying stages. But it was ropey in a lot of places from Jabbur. Tough watch that one. Yeah, it was quite stressful actually because Jabbur was fine. She was a set in the breakup and playing quite well and then suddenly seemed to get quite tight and stressed and then it really ran away from her. I think she was 5-1 down in that third set. It all just sort of fell apart for about 45 minutes and it really looked like she was going to lose as you say. Watching that my mind did go to what we were saying after the Wimbledon final where it feels like she needs to be a bit of an underdog in one of those big grand slam matches to maybe play a bit more loose and a bit more free. In this match it was only when she was suddenly on the brink of defeat and sort of became the underdog in the match where it felt like she was able to free up and start playing her good tennis again. When she was trying to close it out in two sets she just inexplicably it seemed got quite tight. But in the end a good win I suppose. Her first match since Wimbledon she probably needed to somehow try and put Wimbledon behind her and getting wins will presumably help to do that a little bit. But yeah it was quite a stressful watch actually. Not the sort of fun that you usually associate with Ons Jaber and she's now got another tough one against Donna Vechich who's had two two very impressive tight wins and I did notice Vechich on court after the match yesterday knowing that she was going to play Ons Jaber. She said that they practiced together at Wimbledon and Donna said I told my coach that I'm never practicing with her again presumably because of all the slice and the variety and maybe not just a good practice partner not someone who's going to give you a lot of rhythm and a lot of balls. So yeah she said it in a nice sort of jokey way. I don't think there's any beef between them but yeah intrigued to see how that one goes. Yeah big couple of wins for Donna Vechich. Jennifer Brady and a hard fought win over Victoria Azarenka overnight last night. She'll already be pleased with that week Donna Vechich and I'd say she's got a chance against Ons Jaber. She really shows up for that one. Pegula just keeps on showing up and toughing it out. She was in such a tussle against Martina Trevisan and I did it cross my mind you know. Does she really have the motivation in the stomach given she's already had a great hard-court season. She's got what she needs ahead of the US Open. She might already be feeling a bit overcooked and in need of a rest ahead of a Grand Slam which she presumably has significant ambitions of winning. Does she really have the fire in the belly to get into the trenches to win this one? Well she made me look silly for that thought even crossing my mind because I mean she lives in the trenches doesn't she? She loves it there David. Well it crossed my mind too when I saw her lose that first set because you do ask yourself the question is this hitting the wall? Is this last week was as maybe Yannick Sinner found it a lot a great achievement and blummin' hell got to go again from the start at another tournament same level blummin' it. It's a big ask I think and I have such admiration for her. She's growing on me more and more all the time. Just what an admirable character she is and I am starting to enjoy watching her play more and I just somebody who just keeps showing up when they're not necessarily part of the conversation as much as those three particular big names at the top of the sport and then we had the little flirtation of Barbara Krachikova maybe being in that group as well and Pegula yes she's had some disappointments at the Grand Slams and I think there's still a massive question mark there but week in week out she comes and she plays and she produces and I'm here for that. Yeah Carolina Mukova is having a week two tough wins for her Beatriz Haddad-Meyer she looked down and out in that one she lost the opening set she was having treatment I was talking about the curse again on the WhatsApp group decided to switch over to another match because couldn't bear to watch injured Mukova again check the scores she had won and she backed it up with a win over Petra Martic as well now plays Maria Sakary of course it was Sakary that Mukova beat in the opening round of Roland Garros wasn't it to kind of take up her seeding and scheduled path through that draw. Coco Goth beat Maya Sharif 6-2 6-2 now plays Linda Noskova who I think won a check off with Petra Kvitova didn't she that match was happening yesterday was keeping an eye on it. Svijantec is rolling beat Daniel Collins 6-1 6-love didn't understand really why Daniel Collins wasn't able to make that match closer she was awful she played a kind of dumb dumb match it felt like she not gave up she was still sort of physically putting the effort in she wasn't giving up on points but it felt to me like her mind checked out of that and she just thought I've got no chance here I'm just gonna kind of bash the ball around and the scoreline reflected that one in love for Svijantec. Zheng Xiumen next for Svijantec of course we all have made our assessments of Zheng Xiumen well maybe I'm speaking for you and I shouldn't but I feel like I've made my assessment of how good Zheng Xiumen can be on the basis of one set she won against Igor Svijantec at the French Open last year and she hasn't done what I thought she would do since then she's still incredibly young and I believe she has the talent still to to kick on and achieve good things but I'm interested to see her to see where she stacks up against Svijantec 14 months on. Yeah me too it's such a tennis thing how like you know it's very possible that we'd be doing quite a big section on this podcast if yesterday's match against Venus Williams had gone differently you know Venus Williams was was a set and two love up against Zheng Xiumen before you know and really playing well crushing the ball it was it was incredible it was it was backing up a top 20 win that Venus Williams had had over Veronica Kudama-Tovar a couple of days before just just you know great to see and yet from a Zheng Xiumen perspective it was like well you know what's happening here but then she gets through that match wins you know I think 12 of the last 13 games and now I'm really interested to see how she fares against Igor Svijantec again it's just narratives of players can can just change so so quickly in tennis that it's always so difficult to grasp sort of even even what kind of form a player is in because yesterday was such a match of two halves is is the first half Zheng Xiumen going to show up in which case she's not winning many games against Igor Svijantec or is the Zheng Xiumen that we know she can be going to show up in which case I think she can really push Svijantec it's always sort of fascinating to me how how thin the line seems to be between those two but yeah you're right I think it was that match against Svijantec that really brought it to everyone's attention just how good she could be but the signs have been good recently partnered with Winforset won her first title this is an opportunity now to you know to push on again even if she loses I think I think it would be it would be nice to see her perform well and have another big moment feels like she hasn't had that that moment for a year or so yeah it was awesome seeing Venus Williams beat Veronica Kurumitova it was it was absolutely awesome and I told I was expecting that to be just a cool awesome moment in itself I hadn't got my hopes up for her continuing the run and then there she is is setting a break up against Zheng Xiumen and the stats already been produced about it the fact that it had it happened it would have been the first time she's won back-to-back matches in four years and yeah I suddenly was like this is just the absolute coolest thing ever and I should have just settled settled for the moment because as we know it is the hope that kills but Venus is Venus is an absolute queen and I'm assuming she's got a US Open wildcard I saw the men's wildcards have been announced with the women's as well yeah it'd be her great be her 24th US Open Blumenack that's that's bonkers I mean I remember watching live her final against Martina Hingis and waking up in the middle of the night to watch it I think here in the UK it was um but you you were you were one years one year old Matt at the time yes so I was I was quite likely awake in the middle of the night yeah wow it's mad wow would um would anyone care to make predictions at this stage of proceedings and don't just stick with the prediction you made at the beginning of the week for the sake of it I want to genuinely know on the basis of you know having seen four days of this tournament already so far who who you think's winning each title well Katherine you handed me the Cocoa Golf baton from last week and I dutifully picked it up uh for the predictions but I have to be honest a lot of that was points based I there were there are I don't know how many but there were a lot of points on offer for Cocoa Golf I do think she is looking good I am increasingly persuaded by her and the Brad Goldblum involvement and what he did with Andy Roddick's backhand when he first took over him 20 years ago just makes me think of of the effects he can have and and the ways he maybe has helped clear her mind but then I still come back to what you said the other day what happens if and when she faces Igor Sviontek and I believe well she's in the same half of the draw as her and Sviontek is looking really good so I expect her to win I still think when everything happens if and everybody plays their best tennis I expect Sviontek to win so I'd go for her and in the men's even if she plays Rebecca? Yes at the moment I would have concerns over Rebecca just physically uh after last week and I the US Open will be very interesting to me because I think when those two and so when those top three play their best tennis it's very very close I feel before you could you could really choose any of them and and and it might just be on the day in the men's I would probably go for Djokovic just because he he just looks balanced he looks fresh and I don't know I'd still go with him. Matt? Well unlike David I'm doing badly in the prediction so I have to make predictions and I think are going to happen and and I did go with Igor Sviontek so I will I will stick with that kind of for all the reasons David's just said also I think I think a lot of the players that I would expect to push her might be tired or kind of running out of gas a little bit you know we're back in a Sabalenka hasn't been particularly convincing last couple of tournaments Pugula you know she might hit the wall at some point over the next few rounds like it feels like Sviontek probably should win this tournament so I'll go with her men's side I find it so hard just because I've got I've got very little to go on with Djokovic but I mean other than you know 15 years of him winning everything obviously but in in this moment I don't know how he's looking so much I'll I'll go Alcares on on the same basis as last week if Alcares is in a draw yeah I tend to pick him yeah yeah by the way Catherine I'm not impressed with Medvedev from what I've been watching in this match he's a second 2-1 he's what he's what 2-1 up in the second but he's it's been so erastro and it's really not been a good match at all he looks look I know he's not a power player but he looks underpowered to me yeah and when he tries to heave the ball he's missing it was very really seems like he's only got a rally and eventually Medvedev misses look I only picked him because once again I was too slow off the mark and I missed the pick I really wanted who was that I wanted Sabalenka I don't think I think I would pick Svantec now but I guess Sabalenka's got a chance but I watched Medvedev last week and he he wasn't there at all he looked like his heart wasn't I can't quite remember who he lost to but Diminor right yeah he looked I mean he was 5-1 up in the first set tiebreak in that match I think so well maybe even 6-1 actually should have won that first set but when he didn't it looked to me like he didn't have the stomach for that fight and I thought okay yeah he will he will recognize that wasn't good enough and that he'll need to to find something this week in Cincinnati and I know he loves Cincinnati he's got a good record there I just I don't know I was wrong long story short because you're right David he looks I mean he looks away off beating Zverev at the moment let alone beating any top player and winning the title here so yeah weird I really wasn't expecting him to have a dip in form on the US Hardcourt was was not expecting that at all don't quite know what to read into it I suspect I mean his pre-tournament press conferences are always a joy aren't they but I suspect his I mean look he's still in this tournament but I suspect his pre-US open press conference might be fascinating because he's honest isn't he he'll tell us how he's feeling and and what's going on in his head so that is it I think for your well not for Cincinnati there's still three and a half more days of that and we'll be back to wrap it up on Monday a pod that all being well will be recorded or at least two-thirds recorded from Heathrow Airport again what could go wrong one-third recorded in Solly Hole I expect to be very excited and pumped I am I mean I'm I'm always pumped for for Grand Slam trips they are it I mean it's just an absolute treat and a privilege that we get to go to the four Grand Slams for the pod but going to New York for the US Open is maybe it's because I did it as a kid with my dad a couple of times going going specifically to New York as a fan for the US Open that it sort of triggers those memories for me but I am excited so expect those vibes on Monday's podcast if you can't wait till then for your next podcast and you're a friend of the tennis podcast then you're in luck if you're not a friend of the tennis podcast then you know how to sort that out because yesterday we recorded the Kim Kleister's story it's up and it's available for friends our latest edition of Tennis Relived the US Open edition for this year it includes her finally winning a Grand Slam final at the fifth attempt at Flushing Meadows in 2005 something of course that we ended up serendipitously talking a lot about in the last stages of Wimbledon this year pertaining to Te'wan's Jabir of course but we also talk about her incredible comeback after retirement and giving birth to her daughter Jada to win the US Open in 2009 as a wild card it's a moment that will make you smile to relive the scenes of Kim and her daughter celebrating on the court scenes that I think live long in the memory of so many tennis fans and a victory that was a mix of emotions for Kim herself. Pretty soon after I think when I went to the hotel I kind of had a really bad kind of breakdown moment where I guess the reality of it all sinks in because after my dad had passed away I got invited to play at Wimbledon for the opening of the the roof on Centre Court and kind of started training and I guess looking back on it maybe didn't properly take the time to grieve the loss of my father because it was a very intense year and then because I remember there were moments where you know my dad when he wasn't traveling with me I would kind of always give him a call really quickly before a match if I was a little bit nervous or something and and I'd caught myself walking into the locker room and I think it was before the match against Venus and started dialing his number real quick and I was like oh my god what am I doing like he's not around anymore like what but it was such a habit for me to speak to him even when it was like nighttime in Belgium and so yeah I had that moment which I felt like okay it's the realization of certain losses and they kick in and right up it was great and exciting but then after a while I kind of the you you you think and you have this moment and you relive your the past months years that you've gone through and and I think the reality of it sinks in and and and the disbelief the yeah like what just happened like how is this possible Yeah that just a snippet of the incredible contribution that Kim Kleister herself made to this podcast she was so generous with her time she told stories and gave perspectives that I've never heard before despite Kleister's 2009 US Open win being right in the speed spot of my tennis fandom I followed that run so closely and I remember those scenes of her and Jade are on the court celebrating afterwards so vividly I still learned so much about Kim and and her story over the course of that episode so that is up and available for friends if you'd like to become a friend the link to do that is in our show notes already a friend is Katie Sullivan because she has brought today's episode mascot Usher into our lives Usher is a 12 year old labradoodle from British Columbia Kate and her husband got Usher when they lived in Boston in 2010 as a bribe to the kids to make the move abroad more appealing he turned out to be an awesome dog who loves people and chasing balls all over Wandsworth Common now they're back in the UK and that is just lovely lovely Katie and I'm looking at a picture now of Usher he's staring dead at the camera points for that not easy with the dog and he looks like your classic man's best friend I see a lot of um a lot of labradoodles on Wimbledon Common and they're always just loving life I mean dogs do love life don't they but labradoodles are an absolutely delight and Usher looks exactly that so thank you Katie thank you Usher thank you to our mascots David's got Maisie mine is Xenia and Matt's is Darwin Billy Jean is sponsored by Billy Jean King and Alana

Lindsay Davenport have a bit of a go at the WTA the other day on tennis channel for not having announced the WTA finals date or location yet which which I found quite interesting and yeah we know nothing here we are in August and we don't know where the WTA finals is going to be or when so yeah and I genuinely don't know whether that's because the WTA know but aren't ready to make it public for whatever reason or whether they don't even know I don't know what they know we will try and do some investigations folks but in the meantime Lindsay thank you yeah thanks Lindsay we've also got
