Hi, my name is Steve Martin and I feel sad about being Conan O'Brien's only friend. Hey there, welcome to Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend. And no, Sona was not just punching me before she fled back to her chair. You swatted her elbow first. Yeah, you did. You scooted over in your hair. No, I was trying to help her. She seemed unsteady and I would never swat at anyone. She seemed unsteady and I was helping her adjust herself in her seat. Oh, okay. I didn't realize. I think you were just angry. I was talking about how many cups you had. You had like four cups. You didn't realize there was a narc over here. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Get ready. This guy's working for jobs. Just before the podcast started, maybe I took a swing at Sona's shoulder, slightly missed it and then she needed to retaliate. And then of course, teacher, teacher, I saw what happened. I did see what happened. From Mr. Matt Gorley over here. I did and I tell the truth. I appreciate it, Matt. You're a truth teller. You're welcome. Because Sona, no one asked you. You my big geek baby. What the fuck was that? Sometimes I start speaking before I know where I'm headed. Wait a minute. Sometimes. That is 97% of the time. Here are the three things that went through my head, RoboCop style. Like I had a readout of options. It was my big baby, my big daddy and my big gay boy. I'm none of those things. You're none of those things. I'm not saying this is like good or right or healthy. I have a problem. I liked it. This seconds ago, I was taking a swing at Sona and she was returning fire by swatting at me and then you end up the villain. Am I the villain? You're the misunderstood genius. I appreciate it. I'm looking it up right now and no, villain and fool. Okay, big giggy. Oh boy. You're just the worst. Oh, it's faulty. The wiring's off but someday it'll get there. I do love, I used to love when people would get really angry and try to yell at someone and swear but not be able to pull it off. And I knew people that would do that. I know someone in particular, I won't name them but they'd be like, Shit, sugar. Fuck, fuck, fuckler. And they just couldn't put it together. That's my, that's me. Al, Al, Al damn you. Shit, man. What? Yeah. It's just so easy to curse though. Let's see it. Go ahead, genius. You fucking piece of shit, dick fuck. You're just a big sandpaper baby who's got little feet and don't even know who cheek people are. That's a good one. And, and the fact that you don't know who cheek people are is your worst quality. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go buy some lips, you reach around. What? Okay. You know what? It doesn't work. Now you're on fire. Okay. You started out, I mean, good Lord. You didn't have it earlier. Yeah, now it works. Yeah, now it's fantastic. Yeah. No, but Sona, you are very good. I've seen Sona get mad many times and often I have to say not at me, just at random people and you are terrific at swearing. I am great. I am really good at it. You are concise. Yes. They explode out of your face, these curses. Is this the way you grew up? No. My mom would be horrified that I'd be cursing. They're nice people. And I think that's why I got good at it. That's why, because my mom didn't want me to curse and so I was like, well, I'm going to show you, I'm going to curse the best out of anybody. Curse of blue streak. Yeah. Well, good for you. Thank you so much. You overcame your obstacles. My dad, no joke, cursed a lot and I'm wondering why I'm bad at cursing because I never got to exercise that muscle. My father, I have a specific memory, which is my father, there wasn't much swearing in our house. Occasionally, there wasn't. There wasn't much swearing in our house. Occasionally. Okay, that's nice. I'm being serious. That's true. You're good at cursing. What are you talking about? The Irish. No, the Irish curse means we have small penises. Not that Irish curse makes more sense. Yeah, please. That's the Irish curse. Okay. All right. I mean, I've been looking for mine for years. Oh, man. Give me a map. What were you gonna say? No, we're going to stick on this theme now. I've used ways to find it. We could go somewhere else. It's fine. I'm not gonna say it's a blood C plus. Anyway. You dropped your penis. It's at the bottom of that tequila bottle. So anyway, no, I grew up in a very proper house. My mother really didn't want swearing and there wasn't a lot of swearing, really none at all. And then I'll never forget, I had my room was up in the attic. I lived up there with my brother Neil and my sister Kate. And we were, there were so many of us, they said, okay, some of you were going up to the attic and it was pretty clear who was headed up there. So I'm at the end of the attic. Now what I remember is you're saying you didn't draw straws. Oh, no, no, we didn't draw straws. It was you three, you three up into the attic now. And we'll send a plate of food and you can figure out who gets it. There was plenty of space, a lot of empty bedrooms. Tons of rooms. Tons of rooms. Boarding house, basically. No, no, we had a car on a revolving display on the second floor. That's how much extra room we had. 1975 Buick Skylark. There was just so much extra room. But anyway, so I'm up there and I'm in my bedroom and it's dark out. And all I remember is my father was coming up and he was trying to, he was trying to find something and it was very late. And my sister Kate was not in her room at the time. I think they were doing some work in that room. And all I know is that there was a bunch of junk in there, including a big bed frame that was jutting out at a weird angle. And so I'm in my bed and I'm just about to fall asleep and my closet connected to my sister's closet. Like you could walk from one right through to the other. So there was, yeah, it was just a way for my sister to escape or for me to escape. It's the kind of house we lived in. Anyway, but I'm not lying. They did connect. There was just an opening and you could walk right into the other room. And so it's dark out and I'm just kind of falling asleep. And my father comes up the stairs and he's looking for something in Kate's room, but it's dark. And all of a sudden I hear this unmistakable sound of his shin hitting the iron bed frame that's jutting out in the darkness. And I heard every single swear you could ever imagine. Oh, you're censoring yourself, but he didn't. It's funnier to me that it's just, I remember it. It was so jarring and so dramatic. I remember it as, and I heard every swear that's ever been invented from this very brilliant scientist. You learned it all in one fell swoop. In one, I mean, I had a recorder running and I've had them all. It's like, yep, he got every single one. And I remember just pulling the blanket over my head. Oh my God. Did he have colloquial swears? Because my dad for some reason had his own jazz swear lingo where he would go, God damn it anyway and God damn it all. Make sure you damn it every single way you can and all of it. And he would put up the tree. But what does God damn it anyway mean? He would put up the Christmas tree. He would put up the Christmas tree. God damn it just completely takes the power away to God damn it anyway. No, it wasn't like that. He put up the Christmas tree and it wouldn't work. I love this man and I love him for this, but he'd be like, God damn it anyway. God damn it all. And these were just like, I don't know if they were like passed down through the family or what, but I now will stub a toe or something and like I have to stop myself from going God damn it anyway. I think that's why I go to like, you're a cheek people or a tooth lover. I don't know. I just want to get away from it. I want to stop the cycle. We had a lot of ethnic curse words in our like a lot of Turkish ones and Armenian ones. Yeah. Well, one of my, this is bad for people who actually know what I'm saying. They're bad, but like one was like Baba Janana Sichim or you know Pezevikisholishik, things like that. My dad said when he hit his shin, that's he was Turkish. My dad's Turkish. Oh my God. What does that mean? What does that mean? What was all shit on your dad's soul? My dad would say that to people and sometimes like, you know, he'd do it as a throw away. I'll shit on your dad's soul. That is fantastic. Turkey, you devils. What was the other one? Ones like Pezevikish is like a pimp or Sichid is like fuck it or you know, Isholishik is like a son of a donkey. You know, it's, it's a lot of fun. I mean, whatever, but I'll shit on your dad's soul. They should win the Olympics. Yeah, because that's graphic and poetic. Yeah. It's like figurative. It is also very gross. And I think of the soul as being ethereal, like shit would drop through it. But no, this is proof that the soul has some viscosity. But what if the only way you could materialize a soul is to shit on it and you find like, you know, when you pour paint on the invisible man, if you shit on the soul, you can trap a soul. Right. You can put a toilet bowl next time. Make sure there's nobody's soul in there. Oh no, I just flushed Grandma. Oh man. Well, she's going to a better place. Don't shit on Grandma's soul. She's going to a better place. The water salinization plant. Yeah, in our house, it was all Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I mean, it was all Catholic stuff. And, and so it didn't really, it was just more of a prayer. More of a litany. Grandma didn't swear? Oh my God, no. My Grandma Maddy who lived with us. I didn't, I don't know why I just think Irish people are just, they swear. No, you're thinking of pirates. No. No, my Irish grandmother was the most, she was a very well educated school teacher and she lived with us and she would say, Oh Moses, Oh Moses. That was the, and she would say it all the time. Like what's wrong, Maddy? Nothing. Oh, Moses. Oh God. Oh God. That's like a haunted house. Like, what a spot on those windows. You just hear that at night. Well, she loved bad news too. She loved the, oh Maddy, something terrible happened. Oh, tell me, tell me. And she would love, because the Irish love bad news. So once it was her birthday. And so I said, Hey, Maddy, happy birthday. And I jumped off the top steps of our stairway and pretended to get hurt because I thought that would make her happy. Happy birthday. And I jumped and then I was like, did you like that? I thought it was hurt for a second. Oh, Moses. Thank you. Thank you. Well, anyway, this was a very educational, I think. So I will never shit on your soul. Oh, that's really nice. Wait, thinking. Nope, I won't. Oh, okay. Okay, everybody, settle down. Please, I want you to settle down. Sorry. I've got some exciting news and when do I have exciting news? It's never happened. Conan O'Brien needs a friend is coming to you live at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for two shows, November 7th, November 8th, as part of the New York Comedy Festival. Presale tickets will be available starting this Wednesday, August 23rd at 11 a.m. That's Eastern time with the code NYCF before the general on sale, which is Friday, August 25th at 11 a.m. E.T. I'm very excited about this to get your tickets and all information that you need. Head to nycomedyfestival.com and we will see you very soon in Brooklyn. Yes. All right, can't waste any more time. Let's do this. Because this is very rare. My guests today, they are legends, without doubt comedic legends at the top. And they're also my personal heroes. And I'm so thrilled they're on the show today. They star in the hit Hulu series, Only Murders in the Building. I am beyond thrilled. There aren't words, just so happy they're here. Steve Martin and Martin Short, welcome. Gentlemen, it's a rare honor to have you both here. Thank you, Colin. In the same room. I'll tell you one thing, it's rare to be here. I left out the word honor, but it's just an oversight. Just before we started recording, Marty, you verbally assaulted me. No, no, no, no. I said with love that to me, when I see you, you look like someone freeze-dried Prince Harry. That's all I saw. My staff looks forward to any time that Marty can. Pardon me? I have a staff. Wow. Jeez. What kind of podcast is this? It's very looped. No idea. It gets smaller every year. But no, fans of my show, and yes, there are fans of the work that I've done in the past. Let's not have any mock surprise about that. But they have put together a mashup of Marty coming on the show and ripping me apart. And it is wildly popular. Oh, really? Oh, yes, it is. It is wildly popular, and it delights my writers to the point where the last time we were wrapping up the late night show, an epic 28-year run. Thank you. I'm driving to one of the last episodes that Marty's going to do, and he did an extremely funny bit on it, and I'm driving to the theater. I look down and I realize I'm doing something I rarely do, which is wear shorts. And immediately I thought, I'm driving towards the Largo Theater, and I thought, fuck. Who's on today? Marty's on today. And I knew that he would destroy me. And sure enough, you come in and, hello, hello, everybody. And then I see those two eyes dart over, and they see my freckled legs there, and it began. And it began. Well, it was quite a sight. It was absolutely a terrifying sight. And you couldn't, because normally you can't see where the stilts are attached, but you could that day. The shorts revealed way too much. Oh, and they were short shorts. Yeah. 1970s. Yeah, Joey Hetherton kind of like. Like you were entertaining the troops. But the writers were so, so happy. And then, of course, the line that you said it on late night, and it's lived forever, which is, well, you'll do it better than I, but it was, Conan, whatever you're doing to your face, I say 20% more and then stop. Which is mean in nine different. And get into love letter. It's a combo. It's a combo of energy. I love it's also done with care. You're worried about me. A little more, about 20% more. Now I feel like I have to put you down and I've got nothing. No, you don't. No, you don't, because you're Steve. Help. Line. Well, I don't want to embarrass either of you, so I won't mention that you are just two of my absolute comedy heroes. I'm sure you hear that kind of thing all the time, and it bores you. But one of the pleasures of my life, and I'm not kidding, was when you asked me to do a cameo in your show, your live show, Seizure's Palace in Las Vegas. I was outside my body getting to be on stage with you guys. It made me so happy, so legitimately sincerely happy. You killed him. I remember, he did kill. I mean, we learned a lesson. You showed up with writers. One writer. I can't afford to. I showed up with my- Well, you're a writer. Yeah. Oh, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Well, I suppose I am. Now, I, and Matt, he's Matt O'Brien, no relation, but I only hire O'Brien. Of course. And he idolizes you both as well, and he was just in heaven. But I thought, yeah, come along with me and help me tweak a few things, because I really wanted it to be better than what I could do. It was. It was inspiring. And we've had people show up with nothing, no writers, and they did way better, by the way. And then I heard you guys later bumped into Letterman, and he was like, Conan brought a writer? No, no, no, because Dave did it as well, wasn't he? Yeah. In Texas. What was the line? You were sitting off stage with Dave, and he looked, what was it? You were sitting off stage waiting for me to come on. And they'd look kind of morose. This sounds like Dave so far. What was this? I can't remember. Yeah. No, it was a... I remember he was, well, he was, he had... They edit, by the way. He had... Okay. No, no, no, no, he had, oh, not at all. No. An editor costs money as well. Everything is in. No, but it was fantastic. It was, but I remember you were saying that Dave was sort of, he had been off the air for just a little bit. And then, of course, he always does the thing where he's horrified that he, if I go on stage, it'll just be awful. Yeah. And I'm like, you're David Letterman. What do you, you know, but he's done it. And of course the place goes nuts. Yes. And then, and then afterwards he still has a negative feeling about it, even though he killed. Yeah, but he had only been off a few, I think this was like in June and he'd left six weeks before. Right, exactly, exactly. But he is, his personality is always, you know, he came by and, which meant a lot to me, did a cameo on Late Night, which was his old studio, and he came by and of course his attitude was, well, they're just gonna hate me. I know. Well, there's a, you know, there's a... How will they know who I am? That's right. Will you say my name before I come out? There's a self-defense mechanism in being overly paranoid. And then when you get a little cheer when you come out and you go, oh, I was wrong. Yes, yes. I'm familiar with that. Except with Marty. Yeah, I think with me. Yes, I think, and in what, I think it's kept me out of the big money, not having that attitude of just kind of going, oh, you don't like me? Well, you know what, I don't like you either. But good night. No, he does have that attitude. I'm this insecure, shaking one, and he says, I don't give a fuck. Right. They're gonna love me. Well, if they don't, guess what? If I had dinner with them, I'd be bored. That's how I wish. Oh, yeah. Well, often that was your opening line, though. It was, and I didn't know why I didn't play. Who are you people? No one's bathed, obviously. Good night. Where's my big money? Why didn't I get the big money? Why don't they like me? They don't ever hire me again. So I got to see your show, and I was so impressed with how you guys worked it out. And even though you both knew the show so well, you had a rehearsal, and you were still working so hard to make sure that it went perfectly at rehearsal. And I thought, this is, there are no accidents. Like, people that are good, in my opinion, they're, yes, there is talented, but there is talent, but then there's just this just mad desire to get it perfectly right. And it never goes away. Well, I always think that... By the way, I'm here, too. Go ahead. Oh! Did you just sneak into this chair? No, but I'm always amazed that... I feel like I... Should I start raising my hand? Okay, well, go ahead. You say something. No, I don't have... I had something broke. I say, I think we prepare, I prepare out of fear. Yep. And also love, because when we get a new joke, I'm energized, the whole show. I cannot wait to get to it. I cannot wait to get to this joke. And often they don't work. In fact, here's an example, because I thought... Let me just say, when they don't work, I am like either on stage or in the wings, I go hysterical. Yes. Because he's been so excited all day about this. Go ahead. I had a joke the other night, and I thought, when I introduced Marty, I thought, oh, this is really going to work. Right. And then we're going to analyze why it didn't work afterwards. Yes. This man, he's done live television, and he's been in film, and he's done Broadway, and truly, he is a master of the toxic workplace environment. And it was just sort of like, uh-huh. Uh-huh. And I realized later, it's had too many words in it. Yeah. No, no, I don't think it's that. Or it needed to be more of like a casual throwaway in the middle of our chat. It's not some inside toxic. You had to have just read the story about that, um, talk show lady. Oh, you mean be alive? No, no, no, I don't think everyone is following, you know, variety and memorizing. Everybody knows about a toxic workplace environment. Obviously not. We're in one right now. Because you've got nothing on the job. No. Remember that part? I mean, Conan's shorts represent a toxic workplace environment. Absolutely for the crew. No. Oh, we said all that of court. Um, no, it's just, uh, well, I've gone mad trying to just figure out why did one thing work and why did another thing not work is sometimes something works and you don't know why it's because I don't know in a, on the face of it, whether that's, is that really a funny joke? One time I was doing Letterman and they started to laugh and I didn't know why. You mean the show, right? Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. Go ahead. And they started to laugh and I said to Dave, what are they laughing at? He said, nothing we're doing. But I think that we all over prepare so that if it doesn't go well, we don't blame ourselves. That's part of it. Yeah. I think that's part of it. I think that's you. But I over prepare out of fear because I, I shouldn't have any fear at this point. I relate to that. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of the feeling of it not going well is so terrible. I don't want to have that feeling. And yet today you don't seem particularly prepared. Oh, not at all. No, no, no, no. It was you guys. I thought, what are you going to do? Yeah. You know, this is going to be a mess. No, I've said this many times. You know, you were talking to me up 10 years ago and said, do you have a moment? I want to run some jokes past you. And I said, what's this for? You said, I have letterman in a month. Yeah. And that's why he's, I'm not relating to that. I was just thinking about jokes you stick with and they kind of work, but you like them and then you, you let them have their life and then you take them out. I was just thinking one, which I discovered because I was looking back through old material and the joke was in the opening of the show, we used it. I used it in my banjo show, which was, you know, we tried to do, you know, a good job. A good show for everyone, no matter whether you're seated down here in the VIP golden circle or up there, you know, refer to the balcony in the corroded zinc fire pits. It's a little too early for a joke that lengthy, but I just like corroded zinc fire pits. Maybe zinc doesn't corrode and the audience figured that out. You know what happened is the night that the chemist was in town and they were like, you know, actually, no, they just went, what's he talking about? Yeah. I was speaking about preparing. I didn't get a chance to tell you this, uh, Steve, because I guess you have caller ID, but Marty took the call. Yeah, I did. And when you guys co-hosted SNL, I watched that model. You mean recently? Yeah. Oh, that's the only time we've co-hosted. Yeah. That's right. It was, uh, last season and you guys did this monologue and it was over and I've worked there. I've seen thousands of SNL monologues over the years. Uh, I cut my teeth on that show as a young kid watching TV. And I said, that is the best Saturday Night Live monologue I've ever seen. It was perfect. So you didn't like my other monologues I did. No, it was terrible. Well, whenever you would come out to do a monologue in SNL, um, you know, that everyone knew that was the time to go get a drink. Yeah. Well, here's what, he's the bathroom. No, yours. But it was perfect. It was absolute perfection. Okay. Sorry, may I raise my hand? Yes. Uh, so that monologue, we didn't know we worked on it with the writers. We got some things, but we, we decided we're going to do a bit from our show. So that will know we can trust it. Yeah. So afterwards it went well and the ratings were sky high. It was the highest rated show of the year, as far as I know. And, uh, I said to Marty, um, Marty, you know, the monologue went great. And, uh, the ratings were high. So there's a chance we'll be asked back to host it some other time. And I said, and before you say yes, just remember we worked on that monologue for three years. You guys had this, I know it's part of your show. But God, it's a good idea. The I care about Steve and I care about Marty and it's so much so that I've prepared the eulogy already, you know, that I'm going to give for you. And you each have them on you and you, damn it, it's funny. Well, it's one of the funniest things. It's such a great, and the minute I hear that, the minute I heard the idea, I was saying, Oh, Oh, this is a kill zone. Well, the funniest line to me is Steve's opening line when it goes down. Wait, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let One time being on Conan's show and you know, I insulted him a great deal And then I went to the next I was on I went to YouTube to see what jokes I'd done and I read the comments below And people would say, you know, he shouldn't talk to Conan that way if Conan wanted to he could take him apart We did a piece that's a fun person to have dinner when I know why are you making jokes we Had a When I was first doing the late-night show we did a piece where you know The most beloved one of the most beloved people at the time was Mary Lou Ratton the gymnast and she's you know Small and cute and she won all these gold medals and everyone loves her and we did a pre-tape bit Where I think Andy says I'm saying I think I'm getting the hang of this late-night hosting thing and goes Andy goes like You know you could yeah, but the other night I thought you you were a little off and I said I don't you're talking about he cut to a pre-tape of me just losing it Mary Lou Ratton and I'm screaming at her fully committed and we showed that audience Laughs, I think the next day or the day after that I go on stern Howard Stern he takes calls and someone calls in I saw the other night And you your behavior towards Mary Lou Ratton was atrocious I don't think you're funny. That was awful the way you spoke to I can't believe you didn't recognize my voice Reminds me of a Reminds me of a story. I don't know if these are like older elderly jokes stories, but Mike Nichols Yeah, you know was married to is was married to Diane Sawyer Yeah, and he was you know, he's a hilariously funny guy and he would he would say things like That it invited him to a party and said well I'll have to run by the ball and chain so he would call Diane his ball and chain as a joke so then in I think it was a Vogue, yeah, they said Evidently Mike Nichols refers to his wife as the ball and chain Yeah, you know it's a negative thing. So he wrote them a letter which I think they published but said I Realize that humor to your editors is like a cross to a vampire Mike once said Mike once said to me when he we were at this party and he said where are you staying? Is it in New York? I said the Essex house. He said no, but really I Feel like I was lucky in the people that I got to meet but then I'll look at you too And I think you got to meet so many more people, you know, you're younger. Yeah. Yes, you're gonna meet everybody I mean I I remember sitting when I was 21 years old and I was hired to write for the Smothers Brothers that I was very naive and now we're all at dinner and Tom and Dick are having telling stories about people and I'm sitting there going I have no stories I can't believe I don't have a story right and I was 21. So you've got to be this age 180 Have a story you met General Grant. Yeah. Oh my god. What a fun guy. He was But I do think there was that you said Mary Lincoln could be pushy But no even you know, just just in the I mean there's that clip that I've seen a million times I think it's you on the tonight show with Johnny Carson Marty and I think it was Betty Davis sitting next to you She was she had already killed with her three episodes three segments. Yeah, three she's done the plate bit. Yeah, everything. Yeah, she did You're making that up But you mean it she did kill she was she was great, yeah, she was great Yeah, but I just think Oh Johnny Carson is the host of the tonight show and sitting next to you is Betty Davis That's an era of of show visit and I never met Johnny Carson So it was particularly because I loved Johnny Carson. Yeah As we all did. Yeah so much so that I didn't even do his show for 10 years or eight years Something where I when I could have because I thought oh, I'm too hip I just do Letterman, but the reality I was scared to yeah Well, and people don't even understand the era then because it's all changed so much But both of you had this experience where you go on you'd go on Johnny Carson's tonight show and you do your your set And the next day everybody had seen it. Yeah, right and You know, you could walk through a hotel lobby and Steve would just drive from town from hotel to hotel just to walk through the lobby Wearing a shirt that said to just see me on Carson and but people people I Have so many stories that I've heard from comedians where they were not famous They did well on Carson and the next day everybody in the United States is saying great job Whereas today it's just a completely different lens My observation of that is a little different but it's too long and boring but I'll tell you one nod I'm the love to hear that. Okay. Well, I've that's what I believed you went on Carson And you then the next day you were famous right but I found with myself you went on Carson next day Nothing, then you go on Carson again and the next day that somebody looks at you like said I meet you at a party Long time and then finally it slowly starts to break through and finally on my fifth Appearance where I finally got it together. I did a good good shot and I went into a store on Los Angeles Boulevard and that woman said where you that boy that was on the tonight show last night and I said, yes I am and she said oh Well There's always that yeah, and I remember seeing a clip Marty I could tell you're just slightly different You killed but you were just I could tell that you're you're not the Marty that's going on my show And you're just gonna kick the shit out of me. It's gonna be so much fun You are you did a very funny thing about spit take but it was I could tell like his voice is a little different And you're being you're being you're being well behaved Yeah, yeah, I never do I don't know There's a difference between being excited And then to be slumming it, you know, well, there's certain people I've never overcome my awe and Johnny Carson was one of them And that I always felt a little you know, I'm hope I'm pleasing him. Yeah, you know, but they knew they had card games Yeah, yeah, we played cards together. We had dinners. That's a famous card game people talk about that card game It was really fun. Yeah, the lesson of that card game is everything changes. I mean you're having Well, you're having poker games with Neil Simon and Carl Reiner and Dan Milnick and you know Chevy and then people die You know everything changes. I'm trying to bring up the party here. Oh, no, but it's and we're all gonna die, too Yeah, yeah, never. All right. Well, anyway, great. See, so shall we Credits Hey, what if we just prayed I think I'd be very nice and hold hands. Yeah. Well, I often think about that It's it's it's almost my the fact that I get to know you guys and talk to you guys at all is all is Feels like I'm linking to this very important I don't know what I would say is I think everybody has kind of a disdain for their own era of show business and and and reviewers well what we observe and I Probably applies to you that younger comedians like, you know SNL guys that we kind of know or you know them better than I cuz you're a warm person But we see that camaraderie among them Yeah that we assume the you know, like Don Rickles had you know with Frank and yeah But I see that we have camaraderie with people of our generation and I see that we see the younger people helping each other you know, it's a Absolutely. No, I mean people like Fred Armisen and John Mulaney and Bill Hader are all close close friends And you know them I know they they also have caller ID. I Was talking to Fred Armisen once I mean this probably ten years ago He and he's just hanging around SNL and he said the latest thing that we this is probably old now But the latest thing is when you text someone And then the misspellings come up and the different words you just don't change them Just send it off like that, but you do that to other comedians Fred is an interesting guy because I remembered I think we had it We were at a dinner once and might have been at my house and Fred was there and didn't say he's hilariously funny guy But that night he didn't say anything He didn't say a word and I remembered him looking up and down the table and everybody's laughing and joking and he was just Observing at all and he has that almost like you know I always heard Peter Sellers at a party was not a was very quiet and kind of just observing and not I think we were All there. They were yes. Yes, you were there. It was a funny guy's dinner. It was a funny guys dinner there Steve I was yep. Yeah sure were you said funny guys You were a last-minute addition. Yeah, I was the control group Polly Shore fell out I've been so happy for both of you because you've got this crazy smash hit only murders in the building and I was Initially very very happy for both of you and I love the show And then I saw so much signage everywhere I drove in LA and then I would even leave LA and I would go anywhere and I would see both of your faces And I would think You know, that's it. I've no more no more. I can't keep seeing their this is too much This is too much success. I once did a an intro for Tom Hanks He was getting AFI award and the bit was something like this I'd say, you know when I first saw Tom in splash or on the TV show was it was a bosom? Yeah, I said hey this guy's good, you know, I wish him luck, you know And then I and then I saw him in splash. I go. Wow. He's got some real comedy chops good for him That's great. And then I saw him in Philadelphia. I said, she's really emotional actor He's really really good. And then I saw him in What's the word movie? Saving Saving Private Ryan and I thought motherfucker Can you say that at an AFI I guess you can I did nice Very nice. I just yeah, I I was thrilled thrilled for both of you and it's we can see it Yeah, yeah, if you ignore the tears That Actually have blood in them And you both get to be so funny. We are So lucky to have a hit at this stage of Marty's life No, we are it's fantastic, you know and the shows fun to do The shows fun to do we love Selena. We love everybody work with you know You finally get to the the point where a lot of people learn earlier. I'm not working with assholes anymore. It's over Right. It's over. So everybody there is kind and having fun and upbeat and working for the same goal and then I then you guys announced the cast for the third season and I became enraged I know because I Was like you have a royal flush, but you're adding some more cases You've got Meryl Streep. Yeah, I'll tell you I'll tell you a story about Meryl Streep. Yeah, really terror a new one. Yeah Yeah We were we were sitting around and we're gonna start Rehearsing a scene and our you know our head writers there John Hoffman and Meryl says, you know I just want to say how happy I am that we're all here together and working so hard together and John said yeah I agree and you said John that's her first line And It happened more than once there's a scene on stage where she's supposed to she's an actress she's going stage and she'd trip and Then the second take she tripped again It was a you realize we thought she actually tripped and we said there shouldn't someone move that wire and yeah, I said guys I'm and she also she was supposed to do a song with the with an orchestra and she should start to sing and she goes I'm sorry. I can't hear the rhythm and they said what can we know that was her that was her line And it did every time we go. When are they gonna fix that rhythm thing? I can't hear it I did a thing it was for Norm McDonald here in New York and they had some Gathering and I was I guess the MC for lack of a better word, but I gave the first talk But I went up on stage and went head over heels fall people thought it was a pratfall, but it was real And I was you know made a joke of it and everybody thought well And then moved on and then did my thing and then I think the second person Yeah, the second person who went up with the third person they tripped and I went to you know And I said to a stagehand what's going on? Everyone keeps tripping went. Oh, yeah, those stairs have been messed up for a long time They're not and he was like they're not even yeah till everybody trips anyway No, they still haven't fixed those fucking stairs where is that it was I don't remember where it was. Oh, thanks. Thanks. Well, it's that's a little tripping anywhere now We're gonna go trip somewhere. We also Paul Rudd Yeah, and I love that you you have this show that everybody agrees is fantastic Andrea Martin and you add you add Paul Rudd You know, you don't need Paul Rudd at this point. It's making it it's too much Yes, and Andrea Martin and Tina Fey. Yes, and Jesse Williams, you know who wasn't asked who? Oh, I know who wasn't asked I know who wasn't act because Conan has beady little eyes In the first season Conan did oh that that's Jimmy Fallon I Mean your name your name came up. Oh it came up. Yeah. Oh good. You can't like the eyes He's got those Charles Grodin eyes you can't like them they're like a doll's eyes Yeah Listen, you're gonna figure out a way to work me into this sure. Yeah, I think hey with the premises. We're doing a podcast I don't know what you'll be late. I know the title of the episode. Oh, yes. Here we go. The circuses come to My favorite thing is getting excited about the nice thing. I'm sure you're about to say oh good What is it Marty? It's the guy who has no memory of how Martin Short has treated him Over 25 years the absent-minded podcast Or also you can recognize it later that it was an insult Marty said the nicest thing about That's what you're about a podcast I have the podcast Please that's not me talking. That's podcast magazine Guest edited by Conan O'Brien. Yeah, but but but yeah, I'm sure there's gonna there's a way to fix me in You know that get me into the mix, you know, absolutely. Yeah, it's honored reminded me of a joke I don't know why We're doing a show next weekend. So these jokes are going through my mind. It was Marty would talk about me playing the banjo which always insults of course and the joke was and maybe you use it He said and bluegrass Magazine has recently named Steve the official ambassador of the five-string banjo. It was between him and no one Well, you have that great joke it has Deliverance what is oh, yeah, I hope it's such a great joke. What is it touring around with Steve is a lot like the movie deliverance It's all fun and games until the banjos Yeah, you kindly had me to your apartment once and I remember first time I ever met you you do no No, I do I saw you rise up and then fall down No, you came to our apartment and met you or was it no, no, you know, yeah, we had worked together on SNL Yeah, I was very shy. Mm-hmm. And I remembered I don't want to get in Steve So I was writing things but not approaching you. I was in the background but then I was chosen for you know, Lauren said I think this fellow could host the late night show It'll be rough for a few years, but he'll eventually get it. I think he could do it So I'm named Letterman's replacement and the first thing I do when I come out to LA is Lauren says Maybe this is a thing he does but he said let's take a walk through the flats of Beverly Hills Mm-hmm and people told me later on the Lord like takes a take a walk and he's taking this walk and he's giving me advice He's saying always tip you're known now always tip at least 15% real you'll show up in the post That was I thought he was gonna tell me like here's the secret Yeah, but he was telling me things like that, which was fine. And then he said let's see if Steve's in and I didn't know You know Steve He always assumed Steve Croft and so I'm Rossy. Yeah so We he knocks on a door and you answer and you have us into your place and I was like, this is too much I've I've just been put into this situation and I need to Navigate this and now we're dropping in on Steve Martin and I'll never forget you had just had all the paintings Taken down and I think I just said like oh, there are no paintings and you reacted immediately as if you had been robbed Oh my god That's a perfect reaction to where are your paintings? Yeah, whenever whenever in studio I remembered once every now and then you'd be it in the studio at six a rehearsing and The lights would go out because of some situation in the building Rockefeller Center some situation The lights would just go out and Andy would always instantly scream my pearls Well Andy who Andy Richter hilarious, yeah, I was just my pearls and But I have to give him credit, yeah, no, you don't know, you know, no just take it and he was fine I know I'll blow it my per per my pearls my News My Pez How did you guys decide we're gonna start working together as a two-hander a two-hander act? Wonder what had that come about and I know it I'll tell you what It's a boring story. So I'm gonna give it to you. No, no, it was 2011 We were asked to interview each other for it was the closing the just for last comedy festival in Chicago It was May and it was 2011 and we just in what we have for breakfast You had scrambled eggs. I had Come on, man No, and we interviewed each other and that was it and and and it went well and we thought we'd do it again And we just then well the the funny part is we were interviewing each other about comedy for a comedy festival Yeah, so we could talk about comedy kind of like we're doing here But you know to comedy people it's kind of interesting. So we thought hey, let's do that again So we got a corporate gig or something dentist and so we're sitting and we're talking about comedy and we're thinking this doesn't work And then we started and Marty had a show he did Solo and I had a show that I did with a band and so we kind of combined them But he had material and I had a bunch of songs with funny intros Mm-hmm and when we first when we first started working together He had everything and I kind of had nothing because I didn't bring the band I said well, I gotta bring the band so that's when it started to gel into a show and I can go on Did you know? Yeah, I can go on Did you ever it's it's first of all that was great. Yeah, anyway, well I was saying I Was saying that no, I think you said it You know, this is just but I didn't think I got to the part. Oh you didn't Reminds me of I made the mistake once of it's and you know it it's like wearing the shorts, but I knew I I made this terrible mistake of someone had mentioned food and what they eat and I said Well, you know what I do now is I eat two meals a day I have like a shake at 11 and they put a lot of spinach in it And then I try to eat dinner early like at 5 and then I as I'm finishing saying it I see Marty just staring at me the way the way a shark looks like it Looks at a canned ham that fell into the ocean and he looks at me He said, you know when other people discuss the details of their diet. It's boring And of course there were some writers standing around We're like, yes, they love when the boss is attacked. That was also just me realizing I Why did I get into this? Why did I lather myself up with bacon grease and then climb into this para para Napole, why did I why did I do my wife is a very wise about about talking about what you eat She said you're allowed to talk about what you do eat, but you're not allowed to talk about what you it's very Good. I like that. Yeah, I like that I mean if this podcast if we go away with one thing that's it. It's like with me beats I don't One thing I was curious about is when you come up with a great new insult for the other Do you ever try it out in the moment on stage or? Do you ever have to try to surprise each other? Not really, but sometimes we've come up with things and then we'll go right to the prompter afterwards and say right that you know We'll remember what what prompter that if we had a problem, we had a safe we had a problem Yeah, so you're saying if we had a problem and we came up with a joke we would go over and I say no I mean now we just go to our own minds and lock it in Well, we were talking earlier about people you've met and I know Steve that you got to meet or kind of meet Elvis I did and I've told the story a million times. I don't know. I just worthwhile. Well, I just love it So well, I was it was 1971 mm-hmm, and I was opening for Ann Margaret Mm-hmm at the Hilton in Las Vegas, which is no longer there for good reason It's like they tore it down the following day the worst comedy room Yeah, there's a ceiling that's like 80 feet high Yeah So laughs they the laughter rose above the audience's head about two feet. Mm-hmm stop. They stopped but anyway and Elvis was opening the next weekend and he knew Ann Margaret. So Now it's after the show I know Elvis is going to come back and say hello to Ann Margaret and so I leave my dressing room door open And I did my act it's 1971. So the act is not fully formed, you know It's got a weirdness to it. And so Elvis Walked by and he saw me and he stopped and he said son you have an oblique sense of humor And then he came in and now we're talking I'm talking with him I know you don't know what to say and My manager was there who know all about Sun Records who can talk about that and then there was a pause in the conversation Oh, first of all, but this is the part I loved Elvis has a guy who? Comes up to him to get him out of conversation. So Elvis, I'm sorry. We have to go. Mm-hmm And in this case he comes up. Sorry, we have to go and Elvis said it's okay So then we're talking now we run out of conversation then he said I want to see my guns Jesus and We said sure and he was uh, he wasn't he was a gun. He liked artful guns Yeah, I can engraved sure thing and he was very Cautious he they were loaded and so he took out a six shooter and he opened it up and dumped all the the bullets In his hand and before he handed me the gun to look at it and I was looking and I'm marveling at it Then he took out another gun did the same thing Dumped out the bullets handed up to me and then they pulled out from his sock yeah a Derringer and then opened that up dumped out the bullets handed it to me and then I'm I'm holding three guns and he's holding 16 bullets And I'm thinking where is Elvis's guy yeah Remember what he was wearing Yes All white it was Elvis slim and he had the all white and he wore that big buckle that the Hilton had given him to him For biggest show ever in the history of the world, right? But he was very sweet and very nice Yeah, and that comes across when you know that's a famous face though. Yeah, Jesus Well, also the reason I wanted that because I know that you met Frank Sinatra Yes, and who's your absolute idol? But it was obvious one of those situations where you because I remember you told me this once you were at a bar and it It was at George Slaughter's house. Oh George Slaughter's. Okay, it was after a Sinatra Shirley Maclean concert at the Greek Theatre Mm-hmm, and we all went back to his house and Diana Shore was there. She was a big fan of SC TV Oh great. She's going on about it and I'm thrilled to meet Diana Shore. She said hey, do you want me Frank? I said sure sure sure and I went up to him now this next part Paul Shafer maintains I've made up because he said he didn't he didn't speak like out of guys and dolls He said I said mr. Snod at Martin show and he said I know well of you and you're marvelous I know well of you Yeah, anyway then then he said would you like a drink and I said sure he said What are you drinking? I said anything You're drinking Frank And so he turned to the barter and said Jack Daniels and I had don't didn't don't don't drink scotch So the bartender said straight up or on the rocks and I was nervous I thought he said straight up or relaxed and I said I'll have it relaxed. He's Frank said he said straight up or on the rocks Known Frank 15 seconds and I pissed him off. Yeah, Julie beat the crap Now it was when you meet those people it is surreal But you know I used to have that with Mike Nichols and I knew him for 20 years that I was still in awe like you talk about Carson You're in awe of being in their presence. I had I mean, this is someone he both have met a billion times, but Lauren once asked me to go to we he said we'd like to go to a Yankee game with me and I said yeah I'd love to do that and there was a playoff game and the Red Sox and so we're I get in the car and he says We're picking up. I think he said we're picking up a friend I didn't hear who he said we were picking up but he puts you know, so I sat up front So there was room in the back for Lauren and his friend I set up with the driver and we start driving up and then we start to slow down and there's someone leaning against the lamppost And like a very cinematic way and we slow down and it's Jack Nicholson Wow, and Jack gets in the backseat and he goes in Lauren goes you know, he's like, how you doing Lauren? He said other than he says and this is our corner I'm gonna go and he says it's very nice Just said nice to see you and I said, oh so nice to see you Sir, you know and then we're we drive we see the game and my experience was if you want to be anonymous walk with Jack Nicholson because I Am my life is I'm 6-4. I have this pastry on my head I am immediately like me or dislike me Everybody knows it's me and I walked down the street and everybody knows it's me and suddenly Nobody saw me because I'm walking three feet behind Jack Nicholson But then the real treat of the night so we chatted a little bit about a few things and but didn't talk much He mostly spoke with Lauren and then he drops me off at the end of the night And I think well, this has been great and I get out of the car first because I'm just gonna walk Oh, we dropped Jack Nicholson off and he gets out of the car And I just said it was a real honor to meet you, you know, Jack and he said my boy is crazy about you And I said he said I'll never forget He said my boy we're standing there and Lauren still in the car and he goes my boys crazy about you every morning It's Conan this and Conan that it's driving me fucking crazy I Had no idea that even I had but I just knew that I was an irritant in his life and that made me very happy Very happy indeed. I'm just going back a minute because I kept remembering this great joke and I think it was a Shecky greens joke. Mm-hmm about Frank and it might have been Don Rickles, but I think it was Shecky green He said he said and it Frank's in the audience. He said Frank Saved my life one night, you know this joke. No, he says Frank saved my life one night I was in an alley and I was getting beat up You know by some guys and Frank said that's enough And then there's the famous Rickles joke which I'm its story which I'm sure is true which is Rickles asking Frank He's like I'm meeting I'm dating this young girl. Could you this young woman? It would really mean so much if you just came through the lobby and and walk through the restaurant and said hello to me in Front of her that would really help me seal the deal and so Frank Sinatra comes through and walks up to Rickles and his date and says hey done I just want he went at Frank, please I'm eating And Frank leaves the restaurant and then about 30 seconds later two guys come in and pick up Rickles Carry him out of the restaurant and dump him in the fountain Is that last part true it was a it was a fountain it was a fountain of acid Frank had it constructed. Yeah, they killed on Rickles. Yeah, they did. Yeah, he never lived past 1961 Guys, I'm gonna let you go because you have it's been made wouldn't you like to get some part of this interview? That's usable What you're a young lad you haven't you've listened to some of my I'm gonna say this is my favorite episode maybe ever This is my to my or certainly this is a spectacular episode. I'm just going back over why we're doing it It's because of your admiration for me in my world. Well, that's very very famous podcast. I understand that Yeah, I know and so we should be honored to be part of You couldn't say it with a straight face hey I see after this that's you and me go and cash our checks Maybe we'll get some cash and some just a cashier's check Yeah, yeah, and I and I have a servant with me. He could carry the bullion You know you guys have always kept in touch that's what I like about you you never got in the bubble you're out there I'm of the people Kept in touch with whom what do you mean? You just didn't touch with the people? You know, I mean you're going to the bank. You'll help probably have to stop and get a wheelbarrow but But you do it in a humble way. Would you say that with success you changed? I I'm pausing You can't help but change but I'd say I have changed for the better Mm-hmm success. That's what I think right? Yeah, you probably disagree When did you did you know Steve I mean you might met him And three amigos 85 July. Yeah And then we became then we became great friends and then you make that decision of whether you're gonna just Have that two-month experience of making movie and never see someone again or not And I think we both chose to keep hanging were you guys it's interesting you bring up three amigos because you make that movie It it came out and it's you know did what it did But then it goes on and I don't know when it happened But within maybe 10 years of it coming out There's this whole generation that Seizes that movie and says this is one of our favorite movies and it has grown since then in a way that I think is well Deserved but it's kind of fascinating to me. Did you were you aware of that happening? That's what happens with a lot of my movies except for the 10-year part where they like it Well, I've always found that you never know if a movie is a hit or success till 10 years goes by Because some movies are big hits when they come out and then you never hear of them again, right? And then some movies tend to grow I was surprised. In fact, we got a call from a magazine in London and they said we want it was a film magazine They said we want to put you Marty and Chevy on the cover It was and we said why they said well, it's the 25th anniversary of three amigos I said you care and that's when I started noting that there was some kind of right thing happening Yeah, it's got this whole other life and I'm I don't I can't tell you how many times I've seen they'll ask various rock musicians artists Athletes just anyone politicians list favorite movies and then three amigos keeps popping up in there, which is really great. Well, Steve wrote it Well with Lord Michael's and Randy Newman. That's right. That's what you said you wrote the funniest parts Yeah, actually Randy Newman wrote my favorite joke and the whole thing and it's when el guapo It's his birthday Celebrating and he opens a package and he goes it's a sweater I Love the canteen joke so much that you're both. Yeah, you know the Three of you are running out of water Oh canteen the canteen and just there's there's Barely enough and then just luxuriating Spinning out. Yeah lip balm is so fantastic. My favorite joke is that we go into a saloon. That's filled with bad guys We're all in our spangly outfits and I go up to the bartender and say, excuse me, we're not Mexicans We're we're from out of town Was it fun to make yeah, it was yeah It was we were actually, you know in Arizona and on locations and building these beautiful sets Yeah, it's just one of those because sometimes I've known and when you're having a blast making something I've sometimes get worried if you're having a really good time making something that this means it won't be good one of my favorite Lies I just somebody reminded me of it too at the end the very end. I go to Patrice Martinez who's a beautiful actress who played Carmen? Yeah, yeah passed away Unfortunately, and just supposed to be like something between us and I go up and we're about to ride off and I say to her I'll be back one day and she says why Well guys what's the plan for the rest of the day, I'm sure you've blocked out a whole chunk of time with me Well, it's I've got to do my 5b X Workout incredible. Yeah, I'm gonna say you look amazing. Thank you. Yeah, and it's today. It's ab day So I'm gonna work on the abs And that's most of the day I just hard for me for you when you say that for me not to think of your role on Arrested Development Where you're I told you the yeah the bullet, you know shoot me shoot me and my son Adores that show So the times that you've been around as much as you've done you never know what's gonna get people Yeah, and he's seen and really liked your other work, but but you as the bullet Whatever is not your I was a guy I was not so old I was their uncle that my legs didn't work and I had to be carried around Oh, right.

I have a tendency to shoot the lens I look right into the lens Wow good. Yeah, what would it be? Yeah It's funny like monster crushes People and Dennis arrested for murder something like that. But I like I go to you Why do I ask for more? I like Conan's approach because most actors try not to look into the lens. Yes Yeah, I would be have a small role where I'm literally carrying crab cakes in the background at the nice West side apartment and I stop and I turn and look right into the lens and freeze That's what we're gonna do. No Steve's taking a call. No, no. Oh No, I'm looking at the rip my plans for the rest of the day because you asked and then I'd realize I have none Okay, well perfect. Okay Thanks a lot.

Hi, my name is Steve Martin and I feel sad about being Conan O'Brien's only friend. Hey there, welcome to Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend. And no, Sona was not just punching me before she fled back to her chair. You swatted her elbow first. Yeah, you did. You scooted over in your hair. No, I was trying to help her. She seemed unsteady and I would never swat at anyone. She seemed unsteady and I was helping her adjust herself in her seat. Oh, okay. I didn't realize. I think you were just angry. I was talking about how many cups you had. You had like four cups. You didn't realize there was a narc over here. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Get ready. This guy's working for jobs. Just before the podcast started, maybe I took a swing at Sona's shoulder, slightly missed it and then she needed to retaliate. And then of course, teacher, teacher, I saw what happened. I did see what happened. From Mr. Matt Gorley over here. I did and I tell the truth. I appreciate it, Matt. You're a truth teller. You're welcome. Because Sona, no one asked you. You my big geek baby. What the fuck was that? Sometimes I start speaking before I know where I'm headed. Wait a minute. Sometimes. That is 97% of the time. Here are the three things that went through my head, RoboCop style. Like I had a readout of options. It was my big baby, my big daddy and my big gay boy. I'm none of those things. You're none of those things. I'm not saying this is like good or right or healthy. I have a problem. I liked it. This seconds ago, I was taking a swing at Sona and she was returning fire by swatting at me and then you end up the villain. Am I the villain? You're the misunderstood genius. I appreciate it. I'm looking it up right now and no, villain and fool. Okay, big giggy. Oh boy. You're just the worst. Oh, it's faulty. The wiring's off but someday it'll get there. I do love, I used to love when people would get really angry and try to yell at someone and swear but not be able to pull it off. And I knew people that would do that. I know someone in particular, I won't name them but they'd be like, Shit, sugar. Fuck, fuck, fuckler. And they just couldn't put it together. That's my, that's me. Al, Al, Al damn you. Shit, man. What? Yeah. It's just so easy to curse though. Let's see it. Go ahead, genius. You fucking piece of shit, dick fuck. You're just a big sandpaper baby who's got little feet and don't even know who cheek people are. That's a good one. And, and the fact that you don't know who cheek people are is your worst quality. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go buy some lips, you reach around. What? Okay. You know what? It doesn't work. Now you're on fire. Okay. You started out, I mean, good Lord. You didn't have it earlier. Yeah, now it works. Yeah, now it's fantastic. Yeah. No, but Sona, you are very good. I've seen Sona get mad many times and often I have to say not at me, just at random people and you are terrific at swearing. I am great. I am really good at it. You are concise. Yes. They explode out of your face, these curses. Is this the way you grew up? No. My mom would be horrified that I'd be cursing. They're nice people. And I think that's why I got good at it. That's why, because my mom didn't want me to curse and so I was like, well, I'm going to show you, I'm going to curse the best out of anybody. Curse of blue streak. Yeah. Well, good for you. Thank you so much. You overcame your obstacles. My dad, no joke, cursed a lot and I'm wondering why I'm bad at cursing because I never got to exercise that muscle. My father, I have a specific memory, which is my father, there wasn't much swearing in our house. Occasionally, there wasn't. There wasn't much swearing in our house. Occasionally. Okay, that's nice. I'm being serious. That's true. You're good at cursing. What are you talking about? The Irish. No, the Irish curse means we have small penises. Not that Irish curse makes more sense. Yeah, please. That's the Irish curse. Okay. All right. I mean, I've been looking for mine for years. Oh, man. Give me a map. What were you gonna say? No, we're going to stick on this theme now. I've used ways to find it. We could go somewhere else. It's fine. I'm not gonna say it's a blood C plus. Anyway. You dropped your penis. It's at the bottom of that tequila bottle. So anyway, no, I grew up in a very proper house. My mother really didn't want swearing and there wasn't a lot of swearing, really none at all. And then I'll never forget, I had my room was up in the attic. I lived up there with my brother Neil and my sister Kate. And we were, there were so many of us, they said, okay, some of you were going up to the attic and it was pretty clear who was headed up there. So I'm at the end of the attic. Now what I remember is you're saying you didn't draw straws. Oh, no, no, we didn't draw straws. It was you three, you three up into the attic now. And we'll send a plate of food and you can figure out who gets it. There was plenty of space, a lot of empty bedrooms. Tons of rooms. Tons of rooms. Boarding house, basically. No, no, we had a car on a revolving display on the second floor. That's how much extra room we had. 1975 Buick Skylark. There was just so much extra room. But anyway, so I'm up there and I'm in my bedroom and it's dark out. And all I remember is my father was coming up and he was trying to, he was trying to find something and it was very late. And my sister Kate was not in her room at the time. I think they were doing some work in that room. And all I know is that there was a bunch of junk in there, including a big bed frame that was jutting out at a weird angle. And so I'm in my bed and I'm just about to fall asleep and my closet connected to my sister's closet. Like you could walk from one right through to the other. So there was, yeah, it was just a way for my sister to escape or for me to escape. It's the kind of house we lived in. Anyway, but I'm not lying. They did connect. There was just an opening and you could walk right into the other room. And so it's dark out and I'm just kind of falling asleep. And my father comes up the stairs and he's looking for something in Kate's room, but it's dark. And all of a sudden I hear this unmistakable sound of his shin hitting the iron bed frame that's jutting out in the darkness. And I heard every single swear you could ever imagine. Oh, you're censoring yourself, but he didn't. It's funnier to me that it's just, I remember it. It was so jarring and so dramatic. I remember it as, and I heard every swear that's ever been invented from this very brilliant scientist. You learned it all in one fell swoop. In one, I mean, I had a recorder running and I've had them all. It's like, yep, he got every single one. And I remember just pulling the blanket over my head. Oh my God. Did he have colloquial swears? Because my dad for some reason had his own jazz swear lingo where he would go, God damn it anyway and God damn it all. Make sure you damn it every single way you can and all of it. And he would put up the tree. But what does God damn it anyway mean? He would put up the Christmas tree. He would put up the Christmas tree. God damn it just completely takes the power away to God damn it anyway. No, it wasn't like that. He put up the Christmas tree and it wouldn't work. I love this man and I love him for this, but he'd be like, God damn it anyway. God damn it all. And these were just like, I don't know if they were like passed down through the family or what, but I now will stub a toe or something and like I have to stop myself from going God damn it anyway. I think that's why I go to like, you're a cheek people or a tooth lover. I don't know. I just want to get away from it. I want to stop the cycle. We had a lot of ethnic curse words in our like a lot of Turkish ones and Armenian ones. Yeah. Well, one of my, this is bad for people who actually know what I'm saying. They're bad, but like one was like Baba Janana Sichim or you know Pezevikisholishik, things like that. My dad said when he hit his shin, that's he was Turkish. My dad's Turkish. Oh my God. What does that mean? What does that mean? What was all shit on your dad's soul? My dad would say that to people and sometimes like, you know, he'd do it as a throw away. I'll shit on your dad's soul. That is fantastic. Turkey, you devils. What was the other one? Ones like Pezevikish is like a pimp or Sichid is like fuck it or you know, Isholishik is like a son of a donkey. You know, it's, it's a lot of fun. I mean, whatever, but I'll shit on your dad's soul. They should win the Olympics. Yeah, because that's graphic and poetic. Yeah. It's like figurative. It is also very gross. And I think of the soul as being ethereal, like shit would drop through it. But no, this is proof that the soul has some viscosity. But what if the only way you could materialize a soul is to shit on it and you find like, you know, when you pour paint on the invisible man, if you shit on the soul, you can trap a soul. Right. You can put a toilet bowl next time. Make sure there's nobody's soul in there. Oh no, I just flushed Grandma. Oh man. Well, she's going to a better place. Don't shit on Grandma's soul. She's going to a better place. The water salinization plant. Yeah, in our house, it was all Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I mean, it was all Catholic stuff. And, and so it didn't really, it was just more of a prayer. More of a litany. Grandma didn't swear? Oh my God, no. My Grandma Maddy who lived with us. I didn't, I don't know why I just think Irish people are just, they swear. No, you're thinking of pirates. No. No, my Irish grandmother was the most, she was a very well educated school teacher and she lived with us and she would say, Oh Moses, Oh Moses. That was the, and she would say it all the time. Like what's wrong, Maddy? Nothing. Oh, Moses. Oh God. Oh God. That's like a haunted house. Like, what a spot on those windows. You just hear that at night. Well, she loved bad news too. She loved the, oh Maddy, something terrible happened. Oh, tell me, tell me. And she would love, because the Irish love bad news. So once it was her birthday. And so I said, Hey, Maddy, happy birthday. And I jumped off the top steps of our stairway and pretended to get hurt because I thought that would make her happy. Happy birthday. And I jumped and then I was like, did you like that? I thought it was hurt for a second. Oh, Moses. Thank you. Thank you. Well, anyway, this was a very educational, I think. So I will never shit on your soul. Oh, that's really nice. Wait, thinking. Nope, I won't. Oh, okay. Okay, everybody, settle down. Please, I want you to settle down. Sorry. I've got some exciting news and when do I have exciting news? It's never happened. Conan O'Brien needs a friend is coming to you live at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for two shows, November 7th, November 8th, as part of the New York Comedy Festival. Presale tickets will be available starting this Wednesday, August 23rd at 11 a.m. That's Eastern time with the code NYCF before the general on sale, which is Friday, August 25th at 11 a.m. E.T. I'm very excited about this to get your tickets and all information that you need. Head to nycomedyfestival.com and we will see you very soon in Brooklyn. Yes. All right, can't waste any more time. Let's do this. Because this is very rare. My guests today, they are legends, without doubt comedic legends at the top. And they're also my personal heroes. And I'm so thrilled they're on the show today. They star in the hit Hulu series, Only Murders in the Building. I am beyond thrilled. There aren't words, just so happy they're here. Steve Martin and Martin Short, welcome. Gentlemen, it's a rare honor to have you both here. Thank you, Colin. In the same room. I'll tell you one thing, it's rare to be here. I left out the word honor, but it's just an oversight. Just before we started recording, Marty, you verbally assaulted me. No, no, no, no. I said with love that to me, when I see you, you look like someone freeze-dried Prince Harry. That's all I saw. My staff looks forward to any time that Marty can. Pardon me? I have a staff. Wow. Jeez. What kind of podcast is this? It's very looped. No idea. It gets smaller every year. But no, fans of my show, and yes, there are fans of the work that I've done in the past. Let's not have any mock surprise about that. But they have put together a mashup of Marty coming on the show and ripping me apart. And it is wildly popular. Oh, really? Oh, yes, it is. It is wildly popular, and it delights my writers to the point where the last time we were wrapping up the late night show, an epic 28-year run. Thank you. I'm driving to one of the last episodes that Marty's going to do, and he did an extremely funny bit on it, and I'm driving to the theater. I look down and I realize I'm doing something I rarely do, which is wear shorts. And immediately I thought, I'm driving towards the Largo Theater, and I thought, fuck. Who's on today? Marty's on today. And I knew that he would destroy me. And sure enough, you come in and, hello, hello, everybody. And then I see those two eyes dart over, and they see my freckled legs there, and it began. And it began. Well, it was quite a sight. It was absolutely a terrifying sight. And you couldn't, because normally you can't see where the stilts are attached, but you could that day. The shorts revealed way too much. Oh, and they were short shorts. Yeah. 1970s. Yeah, Joey Hetherton kind of like. Like you were entertaining the troops. But the writers were so, so happy. And then, of course, the line that you said it on late night, and it's lived forever, which is, well, you'll do it better than I, but it was, Conan, whatever you're doing to your face, I say 20% more and then stop. Which is mean in nine different. And get into love letter. It's a combo. It's a combo of energy. I love it's also done with care. You're worried about me. A little more, about 20% more. Now I feel like I have to put you down and I've got nothing. No, you don't. No, you don't, because you're Steve. Help. Line. Well, I don't want to embarrass either of you, so I won't mention that you are just two of my absolute comedy heroes. I'm sure you hear that kind of thing all the time, and it bores you. But one of the pleasures of my life, and I'm not kidding, was when you asked me to do a cameo in your show, your live show, Seizure's Palace in Las Vegas. I was outside my body getting to be on stage with you guys. It made me so happy, so legitimately sincerely happy. You killed him. I remember, he did kill. I mean, we learned a lesson. You showed up with writers. One writer. I can't afford to. I showed up with my- Well, you're a writer. Yeah. Oh, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Well, I suppose I am. Now, I, and Matt, he's Matt O'Brien, no relation, but I only hire O'Brien. Of course. And he idolizes you both as well, and he was just in heaven. But I thought, yeah, come along with me and help me tweak a few things, because I really wanted it to be better than what I could do. It was. It was inspiring. And we've had people show up with nothing, no writers, and they did way better, by the way. And then I heard you guys later bumped into Letterman, and he was like, Conan brought a writer? No, no, no, because Dave did it as well, wasn't he? Yeah. In Texas. What was the line? You were sitting off stage with Dave, and he looked, what was it? You were sitting off stage waiting for me to come on. And they'd look kind of morose. This sounds like Dave so far. What was this? I can't remember. Yeah. No, it was a... I remember he was, well, he was, he had... They edit, by the way. He had... Okay. No, no, no, no, he had, oh, not at all. No. An editor costs money as well. Everything is in. No, but it was fantastic. It was, but I remember you were saying that Dave was sort of, he had been off the air for just a little bit. And then, of course, he always does the thing where he's horrified that he, if I go on stage, it'll just be awful. Yeah. And I'm like, you're David Letterman. What do you, you know, but he's done it. And of course the place goes nuts. Yes. And then, and then afterwards he still has a negative feeling about it, even though he killed. Yeah, but he had only been off a few, I think this was like in June and he'd left six weeks before. Right, exactly, exactly. But he is, his personality is always, you know, he came by and, which meant a lot to me, did a cameo on Late Night, which was his old studio, and he came by and of course his attitude was, well, they're just gonna hate me. I know. Well, there's a, you know, there's a... How will they know who I am? That's right. Will you say my name before I come out? There's a self-defense mechanism in being overly paranoid. And then when you get a little cheer when you come out and you go, oh, I was wrong. Yes, yes. I'm familiar with that. Except with Marty. Yeah, I think with me. Yes, I think, and in what, I think it's kept me out of the big money, not having that attitude of just kind of going, oh, you don't like me? Well, you know what, I don't like you either. But good night. No, he does have that attitude. I'm this insecure, shaking one, and he says, I don't give a fuck. Right. They're gonna love me. Well, if they don't, guess what? If I had dinner with them, I'd be bored. That's how I wish. Oh, yeah. Well, often that was your opening line, though. It was, and I didn't know why I didn't play. Who are you people? No one's bathed, obviously. Good night. Where's my big money? Why didn't I get the big money? Why don't they like me? They don't ever hire me again. So I got to see your show, and I was so impressed with how you guys worked it out. And even though you both knew the show so well, you had a rehearsal, and you were still working so hard to make sure that it went perfectly at rehearsal. And I thought, this is, there are no accidents. Like, people that are good, in my opinion, they're, yes, there is talented, but there is talent, but then there's just this just mad desire to get it perfectly right. And it never goes away. Well, I always think that... By the way, I'm here, too. Go ahead. Oh! Did you just sneak into this chair? No, but I'm always amazed that... I feel like I... Should I start raising my hand? Okay, well, go ahead. You say something. No, I don't have... I had something broke. I say, I think we prepare, I prepare out of fear. Yep. And also love, because when we get a new joke, I'm energized, the whole show. I cannot wait to get to it. I cannot wait to get to this joke. And often they don't work. In fact, here's an example, because I thought... Let me just say, when they don't work, I am like either on stage or in the wings, I go hysterical. Yes. Because he's been so excited all day about this. Go ahead. I had a joke the other night, and I thought, when I introduced Marty, I thought, oh, this is really going to work. Right. And then we're going to analyze why it didn't work afterwards. Yes. This man, he's done live television, and he's been in film, and he's done Broadway, and truly, he is a master of the toxic workplace environment. And it was just sort of like, uh-huh. Uh-huh. And I realized later, it's had too many words in it. Yeah. No, no, I don't think it's that. Or it needed to be more of like a casual throwaway in the middle of our chat. It's not some inside toxic. You had to have just read the story about that, um, talk show lady. Oh, you mean be alive? No, no, no, I don't think everyone is following, you know, variety and memorizing. Everybody knows about a toxic workplace environment. Obviously not. We're in one right now. Because you've got nothing on the job. No. Remember that part? I mean, Conan's shorts represent a toxic workplace environment. Absolutely for the crew. No. Oh, we said all that of court. Um, no, it's just, uh, well, I've gone mad trying to just figure out why did one thing work and why did another thing not work is sometimes something works and you don't know why it's because I don't know in a, on the face of it, whether that's, is that really a funny joke? One time I was doing Letterman and they started to laugh and I didn't know why. You mean the show, right? Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. Go ahead. And they started to laugh and I said to Dave, what are they laughing at? He said, nothing we're doing. But I think that we all over prepare so that if it doesn't go well, we don't blame ourselves. That's part of it. Yeah. I think that's part of it. I think that's you. But I over prepare out of fear because I, I shouldn't have any fear at this point. I relate to that. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of the feeling of it not going well is so terrible. I don't want to have that feeling. And yet today you don't seem particularly prepared. Oh, not at all. No, no, no, no. It was you guys. I thought, what are you going to do? Yeah. You know, this is going to be a mess. No, I've said this many times. You know, you were talking to me up 10 years ago and said, do you have a moment? I want to run some jokes past you. And I said, what's this for? You said, I have letterman in a month. Yeah. And that's why he's, I'm not relating to that. I was just thinking about jokes you stick with and they kind of work, but you like them and then you, you let them have their life and then you take them out. I was just thinking one, which I discovered because I was looking back through old material and the joke was in the opening of the show, we used it. I used it in my banjo show, which was, you know, we tried to do, you know, a good job. A good show for everyone, no matter whether you're seated down here in the VIP golden circle or up there, you know, refer to the balcony in the corroded zinc fire pits. It's a little too early for a joke that lengthy, but I just like corroded zinc fire pits. Maybe zinc doesn't corrode and the audience figured that out. You know what happened is the night that the chemist was in town and they were like, you know, actually, no, they just went, what's he talking about? Yeah. I was speaking about preparing. I didn't get a chance to tell you this, uh, Steve, because I guess you have caller ID, but Marty took the call. Yeah, I did. And when you guys co-hosted SNL, I watched that model. You mean recently? Yeah. Oh, that's the only time we've co-hosted. Yeah. That's right. It was, uh, last season and you guys did this monologue and it was over and I've worked there. I've seen thousands of SNL monologues over the years. Uh, I cut my teeth on that show as a young kid watching TV. And I said, that is the best Saturday Night Live monologue I've ever seen. It was perfect. So you didn't like my other monologues I did. No, it was terrible. Well, whenever you would come out to do a monologue in SNL, um, you know, that everyone knew that was the time to go get a drink. Yeah. Well, here's what, he's the bathroom. No, yours. But it was perfect. It was absolute perfection. Okay. Sorry, may I raise my hand? Yes. Uh, so that monologue, we didn't know we worked on it with the writers. We got some things, but we, we decided we're going to do a bit from our show. So that will know we can trust it. Yeah. So afterwards it went well and the ratings were sky high. It was the highest rated show of the year, as far as I know. And, uh, I said to Marty, um, Marty, you know, the monologue went great. And, uh, the ratings were high. So there's a chance we'll be asked back to host it some other time. And I said, and before you say yes, just remember we worked on that monologue for three years. You guys had this, I know it's part of your show. But God, it's a good idea. The I care about Steve and I care about Marty and it's so much so that I've prepared the eulogy already, you know, that I'm going to give for you. And you each have them on you and you, damn it, it's funny. Well, it's one of the funniest things. It's such a great, and the minute I hear that, the minute I heard the idea, I was saying, Oh, Oh, this is a kill zone. Well, the funniest line to me is Steve's opening line when it goes down. Wait, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let One time being on Conan's show and you know, I insulted him a great deal And then I went to the next I was on I went to YouTube to see what jokes I'd done and I read the comments below And people would say, you know, he shouldn't talk to Conan that way if Conan wanted to he could take him apart We did a piece that's a fun person to have dinner when I know why are you making jokes we Had a When I was first doing the late-night show we did a piece where you know The most beloved one of the most beloved people at the time was Mary Lou Ratton the gymnast and she's you know Small and cute and she won all these gold medals and everyone loves her and we did a pre-tape bit Where I think Andy says I'm saying I think I'm getting the hang of this late-night hosting thing and goes Andy goes like You know you could yeah, but the other night I thought you you were a little off and I said I don't you're talking about he cut to a pre-tape of me just losing it Mary Lou Ratton and I'm screaming at her fully committed and we showed that audience Laughs, I think the next day or the day after that I go on stern Howard Stern he takes calls and someone calls in I saw the other night And you your behavior towards Mary Lou Ratton was atrocious I don't think you're funny. That was awful the way you spoke to I can't believe you didn't recognize my voice Reminds me of a Reminds me of a story. I don't know if these are like older elderly jokes stories, but Mike Nichols Yeah, you know was married to is was married to Diane Sawyer Yeah, and he was you know, he's a hilariously funny guy and he would he would say things like That it invited him to a party and said well I'll have to run by the ball and chain so he would call Diane his ball and chain as a joke so then in I think it was a Vogue, yeah, they said Evidently Mike Nichols refers to his wife as the ball and chain Yeah, you know it's a negative thing. So he wrote them a letter which I think they published but said I Realize that humor to your editors is like a cross to a vampire Mike once said Mike once said to me when he we were at this party and he said where are you staying? Is it in New York? I said the Essex house. He said no, but really I Feel like I was lucky in the people that I got to meet but then I'll look at you too And I think you got to meet so many more people, you know, you're younger. Yeah. Yes, you're gonna meet everybody I mean I I remember sitting when I was 21 years old and I was hired to write for the Smothers Brothers that I was very naive and now we're all at dinner and Tom and Dick are having telling stories about people and I'm sitting there going I have no stories I can't believe I don't have a story right and I was 21. So you've got to be this age 180 Have a story you met General Grant. Yeah. Oh my god. What a fun guy. He was But I do think there was that you said Mary Lincoln could be pushy But no even you know, just just in the I mean there's that clip that I've seen a million times I think it's you on the tonight show with Johnny Carson Marty and I think it was Betty Davis sitting next to you She was she had already killed with her three episodes three segments. Yeah, three she's done the plate bit. Yeah, everything. Yeah, she did You're making that up But you mean it she did kill she was she was great, yeah, she was great Yeah, but I just think Oh Johnny Carson is the host of the tonight show and sitting next to you is Betty Davis That's an era of of show visit and I never met Johnny Carson So it was particularly because I loved Johnny Carson. Yeah As we all did. Yeah so much so that I didn't even do his show for 10 years or eight years Something where I when I could have because I thought oh, I'm too hip I just do Letterman, but the reality I was scared to yeah Well, and people don't even understand the era then because it's all changed so much But both of you had this experience where you go on you'd go on Johnny Carson's tonight show and you do your your set And the next day everybody had seen it. Yeah, right and You know, you could walk through a hotel lobby and Steve would just drive from town from hotel to hotel just to walk through the lobby Wearing a shirt that said to just see me on Carson and but people people I Have so many stories that I've heard from comedians where they were not famous They did well on Carson and the next day everybody in the United States is saying great job Whereas today it's just a completely different lens My observation of that is a little different but it's too long and boring but I'll tell you one nod I'm the love to hear that. Okay. Well, I've that's what I believed you went on Carson And you then the next day you were famous right but I found with myself you went on Carson next day Nothing, then you go on Carson again and the next day that somebody looks at you like said I meet you at a party Long time and then finally it slowly starts to break through and finally on my fifth Appearance where I finally got it together. I did a good good shot and I went into a store on Los Angeles Boulevard and that woman said where you that boy that was on the tonight show last night and I said, yes I am and she said oh Well There's always that yeah, and I remember seeing a clip Marty I could tell you're just slightly different You killed but you were just I could tell that you're you're not the Marty that's going on my show And you're just gonna kick the shit out of me. It's gonna be so much fun You are you did a very funny thing about spit take but it was I could tell like his voice is a little different And you're being you're being you're being well behaved Yeah, yeah, I never do I don't know There's a difference between being excited And then to be slumming it, you know, well, there's certain people I've never overcome my awe and Johnny Carson was one of them And that I always felt a little you know, I'm hope I'm pleasing him. Yeah, you know, but they knew they had card games Yeah, yeah, we played cards together. We had dinners. That's a famous card game people talk about that card game It was really fun. Yeah, the lesson of that card game is everything changes. I mean you're having Well, you're having poker games with Neil Simon and Carl Reiner and Dan Milnick and you know Chevy and then people die You know everything changes. I'm trying to bring up the party here. Oh, no, but it's and we're all gonna die, too Yeah, yeah, never. All right. Well, anyway, great. See, so shall we Credits Hey, what if we just prayed I think I'd be very nice and hold hands. Yeah. Well, I often think about that It's it's it's almost my the fact that I get to know you guys and talk to you guys at all is all is Feels like I'm linking to this very important I don't know what I would say is I think everybody has kind of a disdain for their own era of show business and and and reviewers well what we observe and I Probably applies to you that younger comedians like, you know SNL guys that we kind of know or you know them better than I cuz you're a warm person But we see that camaraderie among them Yeah that we assume the you know, like Don Rickles had you know with Frank and yeah But I see that we have camaraderie with people of our generation and I see that we see the younger people helping each other you know, it's a Absolutely. No, I mean people like Fred Armisen and John Mulaney and Bill Hader are all close close friends And you know them I know they they also have caller ID. I Was talking to Fred Armisen once I mean this probably ten years ago He and he's just hanging around SNL and he said the latest thing that we this is probably old now But the latest thing is when you text someone And then the misspellings come up and the different words you just don't change them Just send it off like that, but you do that to other comedians Fred is an interesting guy because I remembered I think we had it We were at a dinner once and might have been at my house and Fred was there and didn't say he's hilariously funny guy But that night he didn't say anything He didn't say a word and I remembered him looking up and down the table and everybody's laughing and joking and he was just Observing at all and he has that almost like you know I always heard Peter Sellers at a party was not a was very quiet and kind of just observing and not I think we were All there. They were yes. Yes, you were there. It was a funny guy's dinner. It was a funny guys dinner there Steve I was yep. Yeah sure were you said funny guys You were a last-minute addition. Yeah, I was the control group Polly Shore fell out I've been so happy for both of you because you've got this crazy smash hit only murders in the building and I was Initially very very happy for both of you and I love the show And then I saw so much signage everywhere I drove in LA and then I would even leave LA and I would go anywhere and I would see both of your faces And I would think You know, that's it. I've no more no more. I can't keep seeing their this is too much This is too much success. I once did a an intro for Tom Hanks He was getting AFI award and the bit was something like this I'd say, you know when I first saw Tom in splash or on the TV show was it was a bosom? Yeah, I said hey this guy's good, you know, I wish him luck, you know And then I and then I saw him in splash. I go. Wow. He's got some real comedy chops good for him That's great. And then I saw him in Philadelphia. I said, she's really emotional actor He's really really good. And then I saw him in What's the word movie? Saving Saving Private Ryan and I thought motherfucker Can you say that at an AFI I guess you can I did nice Very nice. I just yeah, I I was thrilled thrilled for both of you and it's we can see it Yeah, yeah, if you ignore the tears That Actually have blood in them And you both get to be so funny. We are So lucky to have a hit at this stage of Marty's life No, we are it's fantastic, you know and the shows fun to do The shows fun to do we love Selena. We love everybody work with you know You finally get to the the point where a lot of people learn earlier. I'm not working with assholes anymore. It's over Right. It's over. So everybody there is kind and having fun and upbeat and working for the same goal and then I then you guys announced the cast for the third season and I became enraged I know because I Was like you have a royal flush, but you're adding some more cases You've got Meryl Streep. Yeah, I'll tell you I'll tell you a story about Meryl Streep. Yeah, really terror a new one. Yeah Yeah We were we were sitting around and we're gonna start Rehearsing a scene and our you know our head writers there John Hoffman and Meryl says, you know I just want to say how happy I am that we're all here together and working so hard together and John said yeah I agree and you said John that's her first line And It happened more than once there's a scene on stage where she's supposed to she's an actress she's going stage and she'd trip and Then the second take she tripped again It was a you realize we thought she actually tripped and we said there shouldn't someone move that wire and yeah, I said guys I'm and she also she was supposed to do a song with the with an orchestra and she should start to sing and she goes I'm sorry. I can't hear the rhythm and they said what can we know that was her that was her line And it did every time we go. When are they gonna fix that rhythm thing? I can't hear it I did a thing it was for Norm McDonald here in New York and they had some Gathering and I was I guess the MC for lack of a better word, but I gave the first talk But I went up on stage and went head over heels fall people thought it was a pratfall, but it was real And I was you know made a joke of it and everybody thought well And then moved on and then did my thing and then I think the second person Yeah, the second person who went up with the third person they tripped and I went to you know And I said to a stagehand what's going on? Everyone keeps tripping went. Oh, yeah, those stairs have been messed up for a long time They're not and he was like they're not even yeah till everybody trips anyway No, they still haven't fixed those fucking stairs where is that it was I don't remember where it was. Oh, thanks. Thanks. Well, it's that's a little tripping anywhere now We're gonna go trip somewhere. We also Paul Rudd Yeah, and I love that you you have this show that everybody agrees is fantastic Andrea Martin and you add you add Paul Rudd You know, you don't need Paul Rudd at this point. It's making it it's too much Yes, and Andrea Martin and Tina Fey. Yes, and Jesse Williams, you know who wasn't asked who? Oh, I know who wasn't asked I know who wasn't act because Conan has beady little eyes In the first season Conan did oh that that's Jimmy Fallon I Mean your name your name came up. Oh it came up. Yeah. Oh good. You can't like the eyes He's got those Charles Grodin eyes you can't like them they're like a doll's eyes Yeah Listen, you're gonna figure out a way to work me into this sure. Yeah, I think hey with the premises. We're doing a podcast I don't know what you'll be late. I know the title of the episode. Oh, yes. Here we go. The circuses come to My favorite thing is getting excited about the nice thing. I'm sure you're about to say oh good What is it Marty? It's the guy who has no memory of how Martin Short has treated him Over 25 years the absent-minded podcast Or also you can recognize it later that it was an insult Marty said the nicest thing about That's what you're about a podcast I have the podcast Please that's not me talking. That's podcast magazine Guest edited by Conan O'Brien. Yeah, but but but yeah, I'm sure there's gonna there's a way to fix me in You know that get me into the mix, you know, absolutely. Yeah, it's honored reminded me of a joke I don't know why We're doing a show next weekend. So these jokes are going through my mind. It was Marty would talk about me playing the banjo which always insults of course and the joke was and maybe you use it He said and bluegrass Magazine has recently named Steve the official ambassador of the five-string banjo. It was between him and no one Well, you have that great joke it has Deliverance what is oh, yeah, I hope it's such a great joke. What is it touring around with Steve is a lot like the movie deliverance It's all fun and games until the banjos Yeah, you kindly had me to your apartment once and I remember first time I ever met you you do no No, I do I saw you rise up and then fall down No, you came to our apartment and met you or was it no, no, you know, yeah, we had worked together on SNL Yeah, I was very shy. Mm-hmm. And I remembered I don't want to get in Steve So I was writing things but not approaching you. I was in the background but then I was chosen for you know, Lauren said I think this fellow could host the late night show It'll be rough for a few years, but he'll eventually get it. I think he could do it So I'm named Letterman's replacement and the first thing I do when I come out to LA is Lauren says Maybe this is a thing he does but he said let's take a walk through the flats of Beverly Hills Mm-hmm and people told me later on the Lord like takes a take a walk and he's taking this walk and he's giving me advice He's saying always tip you're known now always tip at least 15% real you'll show up in the post That was I thought he was gonna tell me like here's the secret Yeah, but he was telling me things like that, which was fine. And then he said let's see if Steve's in and I didn't know You know Steve He always assumed Steve Croft and so I'm Rossy. Yeah so We he knocks on a door and you answer and you have us into your place and I was like, this is too much I've I've just been put into this situation and I need to Navigate this and now we're dropping in on Steve Martin and I'll never forget you had just had all the paintings Taken down and I think I just said like oh, there are no paintings and you reacted immediately as if you had been robbed Oh my god That's a perfect reaction to where are your paintings? Yeah, whenever whenever in studio I remembered once every now and then you'd be it in the studio at six a rehearsing and The lights would go out because of some situation in the building Rockefeller Center some situation The lights would just go out and Andy would always instantly scream my pearls Well Andy who Andy Richter hilarious, yeah, I was just my pearls and But I have to give him credit, yeah, no, you don't know, you know, no just take it and he was fine I know I'll blow it my per per my pearls my News My Pez How did you guys decide we're gonna start working together as a two-hander a two-hander act? Wonder what had that come about and I know it I'll tell you what It's a boring story. So I'm gonna give it to you. No, no, it was 2011 We were asked to interview each other for it was the closing the just for last comedy festival in Chicago It was May and it was 2011 and we just in what we have for breakfast You had scrambled eggs. I had Come on, man No, and we interviewed each other and that was it and and and it went well and we thought we'd do it again And we just then well the the funny part is we were interviewing each other about comedy for a comedy festival Yeah, so we could talk about comedy kind of like we're doing here But you know to comedy people it's kind of interesting. So we thought hey, let's do that again So we got a corporate gig or something dentist and so we're sitting and we're talking about comedy and we're thinking this doesn't work And then we started and Marty had a show he did Solo and I had a show that I did with a band and so we kind of combined them But he had material and I had a bunch of songs with funny intros Mm-hmm and when we first when we first started working together He had everything and I kind of had nothing because I didn't bring the band I said well, I gotta bring the band so that's when it started to gel into a show and I can go on Did you know? Yeah, I can go on Did you ever it's it's first of all that was great. Yeah, anyway, well I was saying I Was saying that no, I think you said it You know, this is just but I didn't think I got to the part. Oh you didn't Reminds me of I made the mistake once of it's and you know it it's like wearing the shorts, but I knew I I made this terrible mistake of someone had mentioned food and what they eat and I said Well, you know what I do now is I eat two meals a day I have like a shake at 11 and they put a lot of spinach in it And then I try to eat dinner early like at 5 and then I as I'm finishing saying it I see Marty just staring at me the way the way a shark looks like it Looks at a canned ham that fell into the ocean and he looks at me He said, you know when other people discuss the details of their diet. It's boring And of course there were some writers standing around We're like, yes, they love when the boss is attacked. That was also just me realizing I Why did I get into this? Why did I lather myself up with bacon grease and then climb into this para para Napole, why did I why did I do my wife is a very wise about about talking about what you eat She said you're allowed to talk about what you do eat, but you're not allowed to talk about what you it's very Good. I like that. Yeah, I like that I mean if this podcast if we go away with one thing that's it. It's like with me beats I don't One thing I was curious about is when you come up with a great new insult for the other Do you ever try it out in the moment on stage or? Do you ever have to try to surprise each other? Not really, but sometimes we've come up with things and then we'll go right to the prompter afterwards and say right that you know We'll remember what what prompter that if we had a problem, we had a safe we had a problem Yeah, so you're saying if we had a problem and we came up with a joke we would go over and I say no I mean now we just go to our own minds and lock it in Well, we were talking earlier about people you've met and I know Steve that you got to meet or kind of meet Elvis I did and I've told the story a million times. I don't know. I just worthwhile. Well, I just love it So well, I was it was 1971 mm-hmm, and I was opening for Ann Margaret Mm-hmm at the Hilton in Las Vegas, which is no longer there for good reason It's like they tore it down the following day the worst comedy room Yeah, there's a ceiling that's like 80 feet high Yeah So laughs they the laughter rose above the audience's head about two feet. Mm-hmm stop. They stopped but anyway and Elvis was opening the next weekend and he knew Ann Margaret. So Now it's after the show I know Elvis is going to come back and say hello to Ann Margaret and so I leave my dressing room door open And I did my act it's 1971. So the act is not fully formed, you know It's got a weirdness to it. And so Elvis Walked by and he saw me and he stopped and he said son you have an oblique sense of humor And then he came in and now we're talking I'm talking with him I know you don't know what to say and My manager was there who know all about Sun Records who can talk about that and then there was a pause in the conversation Oh, first of all, but this is the part I loved Elvis has a guy who? Comes up to him to get him out of conversation. So Elvis, I'm sorry. We have to go. Mm-hmm And in this case he comes up. Sorry, we have to go and Elvis said it's okay So then we're talking now we run out of conversation then he said I want to see my guns Jesus and We said sure and he was uh, he wasn't he was a gun. He liked artful guns Yeah, I can engraved sure thing and he was very Cautious he they were loaded and so he took out a six shooter and he opened it up and dumped all the the bullets In his hand and before he handed me the gun to look at it and I was looking and I'm marveling at it Then he took out another gun did the same thing Dumped out the bullets handed up to me and then they pulled out from his sock yeah a Derringer and then opened that up dumped out the bullets handed it to me and then I'm I'm holding three guns and he's holding 16 bullets And I'm thinking where is Elvis's guy yeah Remember what he was wearing Yes All white it was Elvis slim and he had the all white and he wore that big buckle that the Hilton had given him to him For biggest show ever in the history of the world, right? But he was very sweet and very nice Yeah, and that comes across when you know that's a famous face though. Yeah, Jesus Well, also the reason I wanted that because I know that you met Frank Sinatra Yes, and who's your absolute idol? But it was obvious one of those situations where you because I remember you told me this once you were at a bar and it It was at George Slaughter's house. Oh George Slaughter's. Okay, it was after a Sinatra Shirley Maclean concert at the Greek Theatre Mm-hmm, and we all went back to his house and Diana Shore was there. She was a big fan of SC TV Oh great. She's going on about it and I'm thrilled to meet Diana Shore. She said hey, do you want me Frank? I said sure sure sure and I went up to him now this next part Paul Shafer maintains I've made up because he said he didn't he didn't speak like out of guys and dolls He said I said mr. Snod at Martin show and he said I know well of you and you're marvelous I know well of you Yeah, anyway then then he said would you like a drink and I said sure he said What are you drinking? I said anything You're drinking Frank And so he turned to the barter and said Jack Daniels and I had don't didn't don't don't drink scotch So the bartender said straight up or on the rocks and I was nervous I thought he said straight up or relaxed and I said I'll have it relaxed. He's Frank said he said straight up or on the rocks Known Frank 15 seconds and I pissed him off. Yeah, Julie beat the crap Now it was when you meet those people it is surreal But you know I used to have that with Mike Nichols and I knew him for 20 years that I was still in awe like you talk about Carson You're in awe of being in their presence. I had I mean, this is someone he both have met a billion times, but Lauren once asked me to go to we he said we'd like to go to a Yankee game with me and I said yeah I'd love to do that and there was a playoff game and the Red Sox and so we're I get in the car and he says We're picking up. I think he said we're picking up a friend I didn't hear who he said we were picking up but he puts you know, so I sat up front So there was room in the back for Lauren and his friend I set up with the driver and we start driving up and then we start to slow down and there's someone leaning against the lamppost And like a very cinematic way and we slow down and it's Jack Nicholson Wow, and Jack gets in the backseat and he goes in Lauren goes you know, he's like, how you doing Lauren? He said other than he says and this is our corner I'm gonna go and he says it's very nice Just said nice to see you and I said, oh so nice to see you Sir, you know and then we're we drive we see the game and my experience was if you want to be anonymous walk with Jack Nicholson because I Am my life is I'm 6-4. I have this pastry on my head I am immediately like me or dislike me Everybody knows it's me and I walked down the street and everybody knows it's me and suddenly Nobody saw me because I'm walking three feet behind Jack Nicholson But then the real treat of the night so we chatted a little bit about a few things and but didn't talk much He mostly spoke with Lauren and then he drops me off at the end of the night And I think well, this has been great and I get out of the car first because I'm just gonna walk Oh, we dropped Jack Nicholson off and he gets out of the car And I just said it was a real honor to meet you, you know, Jack and he said my boy is crazy about you And I said he said I'll never forget He said my boy we're standing there and Lauren still in the car and he goes my boys crazy about you every morning It's Conan this and Conan that it's driving me fucking crazy I Had no idea that even I had but I just knew that I was an irritant in his life and that made me very happy Very happy indeed. I'm just going back a minute because I kept remembering this great joke and I think it was a Shecky greens joke. Mm-hmm about Frank and it might have been Don Rickles, but I think it was Shecky green He said he said and it Frank's in the audience. He said Frank Saved my life one night, you know this joke. No, he says Frank saved my life one night I was in an alley and I was getting beat up You know by some guys and Frank said that's enough And then there's the famous Rickles joke which I'm its story which I'm sure is true which is Rickles asking Frank He's like I'm meeting I'm dating this young girl. Could you this young woman? It would really mean so much if you just came through the lobby and and walk through the restaurant and said hello to me in Front of her that would really help me seal the deal and so Frank Sinatra comes through and walks up to Rickles and his date and says hey done I just want he went at Frank, please I'm eating And Frank leaves the restaurant and then about 30 seconds later two guys come in and pick up Rickles Carry him out of the restaurant and dump him in the fountain Is that last part true it was a it was a fountain it was a fountain of acid Frank had it constructed. Yeah, they killed on Rickles. Yeah, they did. Yeah, he never lived past 1961 Guys, I'm gonna let you go because you have it's been made wouldn't you like to get some part of this interview? That's usable What you're a young lad you haven't you've listened to some of my I'm gonna say this is my favorite episode maybe ever This is my to my or certainly this is a spectacular episode. I'm just going back over why we're doing it It's because of your admiration for me in my world. Well, that's very very famous podcast. I understand that Yeah, I know and so we should be honored to be part of You couldn't say it with a straight face hey I see after this that's you and me go and cash our checks Maybe we'll get some cash and some just a cashier's check Yeah, yeah, and I and I have a servant with me. He could carry the bullion You know you guys have always kept in touch that's what I like about you you never got in the bubble you're out there I'm of the people Kept in touch with whom what do you mean? You just didn't touch with the people? You know, I mean you're going to the bank. You'll help probably have to stop and get a wheelbarrow but But you do it in a humble way. Would you say that with success you changed? I I'm pausing You can't help but change but I'd say I have changed for the better Mm-hmm success. That's what I think right? Yeah, you probably disagree When did you did you know Steve I mean you might met him And three amigos 85 July. Yeah And then we became then we became great friends and then you make that decision of whether you're gonna just Have that two-month experience of making movie and never see someone again or not And I think we both chose to keep hanging were you guys it's interesting you bring up three amigos because you make that movie It it came out and it's you know did what it did But then it goes on and I don't know when it happened But within maybe 10 years of it coming out There's this whole generation that Seizes that movie and says this is one of our favorite movies and it has grown since then in a way that I think is well Deserved but it's kind of fascinating to me. Did you were you aware of that happening? That's what happens with a lot of my movies except for the 10-year part where they like it Well, I've always found that you never know if a movie is a hit or success till 10 years goes by Because some movies are big hits when they come out and then you never hear of them again, right? And then some movies tend to grow I was surprised. In fact, we got a call from a magazine in London and they said we want it was a film magazine They said we want to put you Marty and Chevy on the cover It was and we said why they said well, it's the 25th anniversary of three amigos I said you care and that's when I started noting that there was some kind of right thing happening Yeah, it's got this whole other life and I'm I don't I can't tell you how many times I've seen they'll ask various rock musicians artists Athletes just anyone politicians list favorite movies and then three amigos keeps popping up in there, which is really great. Well, Steve wrote it Well with Lord Michael's and Randy Newman. That's right. That's what you said you wrote the funniest parts Yeah, actually Randy Newman wrote my favorite joke and the whole thing and it's when el guapo It's his birthday Celebrating and he opens a package and he goes it's a sweater I Love the canteen joke so much that you're both. Yeah, you know the Three of you are running out of water Oh canteen the canteen and just there's there's Barely enough and then just luxuriating Spinning out. Yeah lip balm is so fantastic. My favorite joke is that we go into a saloon. That's filled with bad guys We're all in our spangly outfits and I go up to the bartender and say, excuse me, we're not Mexicans We're we're from out of town Was it fun to make yeah, it was yeah It was we were actually, you know in Arizona and on locations and building these beautiful sets Yeah, it's just one of those because sometimes I've known and when you're having a blast making something I've sometimes get worried if you're having a really good time making something that this means it won't be good one of my favorite Lies I just somebody reminded me of it too at the end the very end. I go to Patrice Martinez who's a beautiful actress who played Carmen?

But I like I go to you Why do I ask for more? I like Conan's approach because most actors try not to look into the lens.
