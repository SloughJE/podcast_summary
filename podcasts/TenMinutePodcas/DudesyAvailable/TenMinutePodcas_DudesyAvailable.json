Hey yo. Rest in peace, Scott Hall. Hey guys, remember me? It's Chad and Will. Hi, it's me too. Yeah. And we are actually doing something new now. So we figured we'd just come on the old channel. If you're still subscribed, you're hearing this going what the fuck? But we wanted to reach out to you guys and let you know, if you haven't heard through this or that, you know, we posted it, we posted it on the 10 minute podcast Twitter and stuff. Chad and I are currently doing a new podcast. It's called dudesy, D-U-D-E-S-Y, dudesy. And you can get it. It's on the fucking YouTube and it's on Spotify, Apple podcasts, and it's on all the everywhere you get your podcasts. And the interesting thing about this one is that it is actually run completely by a first of its kind proprietary artificial intelligence. That's right. Me and Will just show up. We do what it tells us to do. And it collects data from those things to make every episode better than the last one. And we're pretty excited to see where this goes. We think it is the future of podcasting and we hope you will join us for the first few episodes that we have out now. And we got a new episode coming out every week. Yeah. Every Tuesday, new dudesy. And listen, you know, it's true what we used to say on the old program, it's a program, that's French for program, the 10 minute podcast. We don't have fans. We have friends. So we want you to come with us. There's going to be some things that you might even find kind of familiar and shit, I guess, I guess, unofficially between all of us here, you diamond listeners and us kind of a bit of a continuation a little bit. Well, it's got some DNA. Yeah. It's got some DNA. It's got some bones, some blueprint. I mean, I've been doing Hulk and Arnold at Nausium. Anyway, guys. But that's more like Will Sasso DNA. Even if you're not doing a podcast, if you're just his friend, you're still listening to Arnold's or Zagrad Hulk Hogan impersonations, 24 hours of fucking death. Hold on a minute, dude. Hold on a second, Chad. Okay. Hold on. Hold on, dude. Hold on a second, brother. There ain't no shitty Hulk here, dude. There's no Tommy Blotcher here to kill the bit, dude. Hold on. Don't railroad this. Hold on, dude. You're telling me not to railroad something. Okay. Hold on a second, dude. Here's what we want you to know, brother. You got to listen to the podcast, dude.
